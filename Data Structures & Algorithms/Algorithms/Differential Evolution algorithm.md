**Differential Evolution Algorithm**

Differential Evolution (DE) is a popular evolutionary optimization algorithm used to find optimal solutions in continuous and high-dimensional search spaces. DE is a population-based algorithm that employs a strategy of mutation, recombination, and selection to explore the search space efficiently. It is simple to implement, computationally efficient, and effective for solving a wide range of optimization problems.

**Working of Differential Evolution Algorithm**

1. **Initialization:**
   - The algorithm starts by randomly initializing a population of candidate solutions (individuals) in the search space.

2. **Mutation:**
   - For each individual in the population, DE performs a mutation operation to create a trial vector.
   - The mutation strategy involves selecting three different individuals (target, base, and donor) randomly from the population.
   - The trial vector is formed by adding a scaled difference between the donor and base vectors to the target vector.

3. **Recombination:**
   - DE performs a recombination operation to combine the trial vector with the target vector.
   - The recombination probability determines which components of the trial vector are retained in the final vector.

4. **Selection:**
   - The trial vector is compared with the target vector, and the better of the two becomes the next generation's individual.
   - The selection step ensures that only individuals with improved fitness values survive in the population.

5. **Termination:**
   - The algorithm continues the mutation, recombination, and selection process for a fixed number of iterations or until a convergence criterion is met.

**Example: Using Differential Evolution in Python**

Python provides several libraries for implementing the Differential Evolution algorithm. One such library is `scipy`.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def objective_function(x):
    # Example objective function (minimization problem)
    return sum((x - 1)**2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define the bounds of decision variables
    bounds = [(0, 1)]  # A single variable bounded between 0 and 1

    # Run Differential Evolution optimization
    result = minimize(objective_function, np.random.rand(1), bounds=bounds, method='differential_evolution')

    print("Optimal Solution:", result.x[0])
    print("Optimal Objective Value:", result.fun)
```

**C++ Implementation of Differential Evolution using DEAP**

Google DEAP is a versatile evolutionary computation framework that can be used for Differential Evolution.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <deap/ea/cmaes.h>
#include <deap/creator.h>
#include <deap/tools.h>

namespace deap = deap;

double objectiveFunction(const std::vector<double>& x) {
    // Example objective function (minimization problem)
    double sum = 0.0;
    for (const double& value : x) {
        sum += (value - 1) * (value - 1);
    }
    return sum;
}

int main() {
    // Define the evaluation function for DEAP
    deap::creator::create("FitnessMin", deap::base::Fitness, deap::base::Fitness::GetMax());
    deap::creator::create("Individual", std::vector<double>, deap::base::FitnessMin, std::vector<double>());

    deap::tools::RegisterVectorEvaluation<double>(objectiveFunction);
    deap::ea::CMAES<deap::tools::DefaultIndividual>::SetParameters(10,  // Population size
                                                                   100, // Maximum number of iterations
                                                                   0.5, // Initial step size
                                                                   0.0, // Step size damping factor
                                                                   0.0, // Covariance matrix update scaling
                                                                   0.0  // Covariance matrix update damping
    );

    // Run Differential Evolution optimization
    deap::ea::CMAES<deap::tools::DefaultIndividual> cmaes;

    std::vector<deap::tools::DefaultIndividual> population = cmaes();

    // Get the best individual (solution)
    const deap::tools::DefaultIndividual& bestIndividual = cmaes._hof.front();

    // Print the results
    std::cout << "Optimal Solution:";
    for (const double& value : bestIndividual) {
        std::cout << " " << value;
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    double objectiveValue = objectiveFunction(bestIndividual);
    std::cout << "Optimal Objective Value: " << objectiveValue << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this article, we explored the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm, a powerful evolutionary optimization technique for solving continuous and high-dimensional optimization problems. We provided examples of using DE in Python using `scipy` and in C++ using DEAP. The simplicity and efficiency of DE make it a popular choice for a wide range of real-world optimization tasks, including parameter tuning, function optimization, and engineering design.
