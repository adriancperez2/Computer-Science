**Quick Select Algorithm: An Overview**

Quick Select is a powerful algorithm used to find the kth smallest (or largest) element in an unsorted array without sorting the entire array. It is an optimization of the QuickSort algorithm and is based on the partitioning technique. Quick Select efficiently reduces the search space and focuses only on the relevant subarray, making it faster than sorting the entire array and then finding the kth element.

The algorithm works by selecting a pivot element from the array and partitioning the array into two parts: elements less than or equal to the pivot and elements greater than the pivot. If the pivot element is the kth element, then it is the desired value. Otherwise, the algorithm recursively searches in the appropriate subarray that contains the kth element.

Quick Select has an average time complexity of O(n) and can be faster in practice compared to sorting the entire array to find the kth element.

**Working of Quick Select Algorithm**

1. **Step 1: Choose Pivot**: The algorithm starts by selecting a pivot element from the array. The choice of the pivot can vary, but a common approach is to select the last element of the array.

2. **Step 2: Partitioning**: The array is partitioned into two parts based on the pivot. All elements less than or equal to the pivot are moved to the left, and elements greater than the pivot are moved to the right. The pivot is now in its sorted position if the array was sorted.

3. **Step 3: Check kth Element**: The algorithm checks if the pivot is the kth element. If so, the search is complete, and the kth element is found.

4. **Step 4: Recursive Search**: If the pivot is not the kth element, the algorithm determines whether to search in the left or right subarray based on the position of the pivot relative to k. If k is less than the pivot's index, the algorithm searches in the left subarray; otherwise, it searches in the right subarray.

5. **Step 5: Repeat**: The process is repeated recursively until the kth element is found.

**Example Use Cases for Quick Select Algorithm**

1. **Statistics**: Quick Select is used in statistical analysis to find the kth percentile of a dataset.

2. **Order Statistics**: The algorithm is helpful in finding the kth smallest or largest element in a list without sorting the entire list.

3. **Finding Median**: Quick Select can efficiently find the median element in an unsorted array.

**Implementation of Quick Select Algorithm in Python, C++, Rust, and Ruby**

**Python Code for Quick Select Algorithm:**

```python
def partition(arr, low, high):
    pivot = arr[high]
    i = low - 1

    for j in range(low, high):
        if arr[j] <= pivot:
            i += 1
            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]

    arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]
    return i + 1

def quick_select(arr, low, high, k):
    if low <= high:
        pivot_index = partition(arr, low, high)

        if pivot_index == k:
            return arr[pivot_index]
        elif pivot_index > k:
            return quick_select(arr, low, pivot_index - 1, k)
        else:
            return quick_select(arr, pivot_index + 1, high, k)

# Example usage:
arr = [3, 6, 2, 1, 5, 4]
k = 2
kth_smallest = quick_select(arr, 0, len(arr) - 1, k - 1)
print(kth_smallest)  # Output: 2
```

**C++ Code for Quick Select Algorithm:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int partition(vector<int>& arr, int low, int high) {
    int pivot = arr[high];
    int i = low - 1;

    for (int j = low; j < high; j++) {
        if (arr[j] <= pivot) {
            i++;
            swap(arr[i], arr[j]);
        }
    }

    swap(arr[i + 1], arr[high]);
    return i + 1;
}

int quick_select(vector<int>& arr, int low, int high, int k) {
    if (low <= high) {
        int pivot_index = partition(arr, low, high);

        if (pivot_index == k) {
            return arr[pivot_index];
        } else if (pivot_index > k) {
            return quick_select(arr, low, pivot_index - 1, k);
        } else {
            return quick_select(arr, pivot_index + 1, high, k);
        }
    }

    return -1; // Error: k is out of range
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {3, 6, 2, 1, 5, 4};
    int k = 2;
    int kth_smallest = quick_select(arr, 0, arr.size() - 1, k - 1);
    cout << kth_smallest << endl;  // Output: 2

    return 0;
}
```

            i += 1;
        }
    }

    arr.swap(i, high);
    i
}

fn quick_select(arr: &mut [i32], low: usize, high: usize, k: usize) -> i32 {
    if low <= high {
        let pivot_index = partition(arr, low, high);

        if pivot_index == k {
            arr[pivot_index]
        } else if pivot_index > k {
            quick_select(arr, low, pivot_index - 1, k)
        } else {
            quick_select(arr, pivot_index + 1, high, k)
        }
    } else {
        -1  // Error: k is out of range
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut arr = vec![3, 6, 2, 1, 5, 4];


    let k = 2;
    let kth_smallest = quick_select(&mut arr, 0, arr.len() - 1, k - 1);
    println!("{}", kth_smallest);  // Output: 2
}
```
