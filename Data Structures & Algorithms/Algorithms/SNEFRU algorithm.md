SNEFRU (Secure NEtwork Filling and Retrieval Utility) is a family of cryptographic hash functions designed by Ralph Merkle in 1990. It was one of the first widely used cryptographic hash functions and served as a predecessor to more modern algorithms like SHA-1 and SHA-2. SNEFRU comes in two variants: SNEFRU-128 and SNEFRU-256, which produce hash values of 128 bits and 256 bits, respectively.

## SNEFRU Algorithm Overview:

The SNEFRU algorithm operates by dividing the input data into blocks and processing them iteratively. It uses a set of reversible bitwise operations, such as rotations and XORs, to mix and combine the data. The process is designed to create confusion and diffusion, which are essential properties of secure cryptographic hash functions.

### Hash Function Steps:
1. **Message Padding**: The input message is padded to ensure it is a multiple of the block size. Typically, a 1-bit followed by zeros is appended, followed by the length of the original message.

2. **Message Splitting**: The padded message is split into blocks of the specified block size (128 or 256 bits).

3. **Computation**: Each block is processed iteratively through multiple rounds. The details of each round include bitwise operations, rotations, and XORs.

4. **Finalization**: The final state of the data is used as the hash value.

## SNEFRU Example:

Let's look at a simple example of SNEFRU-128 hash function in Python:

```python
def rotate_left(x, n):
    return ((x << n) | (x >> (32 - n))) & 0xFFFFFFFF

def snefru_compress(state, block):
    for i in range(32):
        state[i] = rotate_left(state[i] ^ block[i], 1) + rotate_left(state[i], 1)
    
def snefru_hash(message):
    block_size = 128
    state = [0] * 32
    
    padded_message = message + b'\x80' + b'\x00' * ((-len(message) - 9) % block_size) + len(message).to_bytes(8, 'big')
    
    for i in range(0, len(padded_message), block_size):
        block = [int.from_bytes(padded_message[i+j:i+j+4], 'big') for j in range(0, block_size, 4)]
        snefru_compress(state, block)
    
    return b''.join(x.to_bytes(4, 'big') for x in state[:4])

message = b'Hello, SNEFRU!'
hash_value = snefru_hash(message)
print("Message:", message)
print("Hash:", hash_value.hex())
```

Please note that this example provides a simplified version of the SNEFRU-128 hash function for educational purposes. A complete implementation would require additional steps and considerations, including proper handling of endianess and byte ordering.

### Disclaimer:

SNEFRU, while historically significant, is not recommended for use in modern cryptographic applications due to advances in cryptanalysis and security concerns. For secure hashing, it is advised to use more modern and widely accepted hash functions like those from the SHA-2 family (e.g., SHA-256). The code example provided above is meant for educational purposes only and should not be used for actual security-critical applications.
