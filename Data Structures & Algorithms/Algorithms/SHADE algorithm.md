**SHADE Algorithm**

SHADE (Success-History Based Adaptive Differential Evolution) is an evolutionary optimization algorithm based on Differential Evolution (DE). It incorporates several adaptive strategies to improve the performance and convergence speed of DE. SHADE dynamically adjusts its parameters based on the success history of previous iterations, making it more efficient in solving complex optimization problems.

**Working of SHADE Algorithm**

1. **Initialization:**
   - The SHADE algorithm starts by initializing a population of candidate solutions randomly in the search space.
   - It also initializes the memory for storing the success histories of the individuals.

2. **Mutation:**
   - For each individual in the population, SHADE performs a mutation operation using a combination of current-to-pbest (C-to-Pbest) and global-to-best (G-to-Best) mutation strategies.
   - The C-to-Pbest strategy generates a trial vector by combining the current individual's information with the information from the pbest individual (the best individual within a subset of the population).
   - The G-to-Best strategy generates a trial vector by combining the current individual's information with the information from the global best individual in the entire population.

3. **Recombination:**
   - SHADE performs a recombination operation to combine the trial vector with the target vector.
   - The recombination probability determines which components of the trial vector are retained in the final vector.

4. **Selection:**
   - The trial vector is compared with the target vector, and the better of the two becomes the next generation's individual.
   - The selection step ensures that only individuals with improved fitness values survive in the population.

5. **Adaptation:**
   - SHADE adapts its control parameters based on the success history of previous iterations.
   - It adjusts the crossover rate, mutation strategies, and population size to improve the algorithm's performance.

6. **Termination:**
   - The algorithm continues the mutation, recombination, and selection process for a fixed number of iterations or until a convergence criterion is met.

**Example: Using SHADE in Python**

Python provides several libraries for implementing the SHADE algorithm. One such library is `pyshade`.

```python
import numpy as np
from pyshade import SHADE

def objective_function(x):
    # Example objective function (minimization problem)
    return sum((x - 1)**2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define the bounds of decision variables
    bounds = [(0, 1)]  # A single variable bounded between 0 and 1

    # Run SHADE optimization
    result = SHADE(objective_function, bounds=bounds, max_evaluations=10000, popsize=50)

    print("Optimal Solution:", result.best)
    print("Optimal Objective Value:", result.best_value)
```

**C++ Implementation of SHADE using DEAP**

Google DEAP is a versatile evolutionary computation framework that can be used for SHADE.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <deap/ea/shade.h>
#include <deap/creator.h>
#include <deap/tools.h>

namespace deap = deap;

double objectiveFunction(const std::vector<double>& x) {
    // Example objective function (minimization problem)
    double sum = 0.0;
    for (const double& value : x) {
        sum += (value - 1) * (value - 1);
    }
    return sum;
}

int main() {
    // Define the evaluation function for DEAP
    deap::creator::create("FitnessMin", deap::base::Fitness, deap::base::Fitness::GetMax());
    deap::creator::create("Individual", std::vector<double>, deap::base::FitnessMin, std::vector<double>());

    deap::tools::RegisterVectorEvaluation<double>(objectiveFunction);
    deap::ea::SHADE<deap::tools::DefaultIndividual>::SetParameters(10, // Population size
                                                                  100, // Maximum number of iterations
                                                                  0.5, // Initial scaling factor
                                                                  0.9, // Scaling factor decay rate
                                                                  0.1, // Crossover rate
                                                                  0.9, // Archive size factor
                                                                  0.1, // Archive truncation ratio
                                                                  0.1  // Memory size factor
    );

    // Run SHADE optimization
    deap::ea::SHADE<deap::tools::DefaultIndividual> shade;

    std::vector<deap::tools::DefaultIndividual> population = shade();

    // Get the best individual (solution)
    const deap::tools::DefaultIndividual& bestIndividual = shade._hof.front();

    // Print the results
    std::cout << "Optimal Solution:";
    for (const double& value : bestIndividual) {
        std::cout << " " << value;
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    double objectiveValue = objectiveFunction(bestIndividual);
    std::cout << "Optimal Objective Value: " << objectiveValue << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
