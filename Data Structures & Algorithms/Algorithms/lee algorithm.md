**Lee Algorithm: An Overview**

The Lee Algorithm, also known as the Breadth-First Search (BFS) Maze Solving Algorithm, is a pathfinding algorithm used to find the shortest path between two points in a grid. It is based on the Breadth-First Search technique, which systematically explores all possible paths in a graph or grid in a layer-by-layer manner. The Lee Algorithm is particularly suitable for solving maze-like problems and finding the shortest path between a starting point and a target destination.

**Working of Lee Algorithm**

1. **Step 1: Grid Representation**: The algorithm starts with a grid representing the maze, where each cell can be either blocked or unblocked. Blocked cells are obstacles that cannot be traversed, while unblocked cells are passable.

2. **Step 2: Initialization**: The algorithm sets the starting point (source) and target destination (target) in the grid. It also creates a queue for the Breadth-First Search and initializes it with the source cell.

3. **Step 3: Breadth-First Search**: The algorithm starts the Breadth-First Search by dequeueing a cell from the queue. It explores the neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) of the dequeued cell.

4. **Step 4: Path Exploration**: For each unblocked neighboring cell, the algorithm marks it as visited and assigns it a distance value relative to the source cell. It also sets the parent cell for backtracking the shortest path later.

5. **Step 5: Termination**: The Breadth-First Search continues until the target cell is reached or the queue becomes empty. If the target cell is reached, the shortest path has been found.

6. **Step 6: Path Reconstruction (Optional)**: If required, the algorithm reconstructs the shortest path by backtracking from the target cell to the source cell using the parent information.

**Example Use Cases for Lee Algorithm**

1. **Maze Solving**: The Lee Algorithm is widely used for solving mazes and finding the shortest path from a starting point to an exit.

2. **Robot Navigation**: In robotics, the algorithm can be used to plan paths for a robot to navigate through obstacles in a grid-based environment.

3. **Game Development**: The algorithm is employed in game development to create AI for characters or agents to move through maze-like environments.

**Implementation of Lee Algorithm in Python, C++, Rust, and Ruby**

**Python Code for Lee Algorithm:**

```python
from collections import deque

def lee_algorithm(grid, source, target):
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]

    queue = deque([(source[0], source[1], 0)])
    visited = set([source])

    while queue:
        x, y, distance = queue.popleft()

        if (x, y) == target:
            return distance

        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and grid[nx][ny] == 0 and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                queue.append((nx, ny, distance + 1))
                visited.add((nx, ny))

    return -1  # Target not reachable

# Example usage:
grid = [
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
]

source = (0, 0)
target = (4, 4)
shortest_distance = lee_algorithm(grid, source, target)
print(shortest_distance)
```

    queue<tuple<int, int, int>> q;
    set<pair<int, int>> visited;
    q.push(make_tuple(source.first, source.second, 0));
    visited.insert(source);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        int x, y, distance;
        tie(x, y, distance) = q.front();
        q.pop();

        if (make_pair(x, y) == target) {

        }

        for (const auto& dir : directions) {
            int nx = x + dir.first;
            int ny = y + dir.second;
            if (nx >= 0 && nx < rows && ny >= 0 && ny < cols && grid[nx][ny] == 0 && !visited.count(make_pair(nx, ny))) {
                q.push(make_tuple(nx, ny, distance + 1));
                visited.insert(make_pair(nx, ny));

    pair<int, int> target = make_pair(4, 4);
    int shortest_distance = lee_algorithm(grid, source, target);
    cout << shortest_distance << endl;

    return 0;
}

    let directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)];

    let mut queue = VecDeque::new();
    queue.push_back((source.0, source.1, 0));
    let mut visited = HashSet::new();
    visited.insert(source);

    while let Some((x, y, distance)) = queue.pop_front() {
        if (x, y) == target {

            if nx < rows && ny < cols && grid[nx][ny] == 0 && !visited.contains(&(nx, ny)) {
                queue.push_back((nx, ny, distance

 + 1));
                visited.insert((nx, ny));
            }
        }
    }
