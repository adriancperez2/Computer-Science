# Rabin Cryptosystem: Securing Information with Quadratic Residues

The Rabin cryptosystem is a public-key encryption algorithm that relies on the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers. Named after its inventor Michael O. Rabin, this cryptosystem is widely recognized for its efficient encryption and decryption processes. It is also notable for being a variant of the more well-known RSA algorithm, with its security grounded in the challenging nature of the integer factorization problem.

## How the Rabin Algorithm Works

The Rabin cryptosystem operates in the finite field of integers modulo `n`, where `n` is a product of two large prime numbers. Here's a detailed explanation of the algorithm:

1. **Key Generation**:
   - Choose two distinct large prime numbers, `p` and `q`.
   - Compute the modulus `n = p * q`, which serves as both the modulus for encryption and the common modulus for decryption.

2. **Encryption**:
   - Convert the plaintext message into an integer `M`, where `0 <= M < n`.
   - Calculate the ciphertext `C` using the equation: `C = M^2 mod n`.

3. **Decryption**:
   - Obtain the four possible square roots of `C`, which are `±a` and `±b`, where `a = sqrt(C) mod n` and `b = -a mod n`.
   - The original plaintext can be reconstructed from these square roots using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

## Example Use Cases of the Rabin Algorithm

1. **Data Privacy**: Rabin encryption can be used to protect sensitive data during transmission over untrusted channels. It provides a secure way to ensure that only authorized parties can decrypt the information.

2. **Digital Signatures**: Rabin signatures can be used for authentication and data integrity verification. By signing a hash of a message using the private key, a sender can prove the authenticity of the message.

3. **Key Exchange**: Similar to RSA, the Rabin algorithm can be adapted for key exchange protocols, allowing two parties to establish a secure communication channel.

## Python Implementation of the Rabin Algorithm

```python
import random
from sympy import mod_inverse

def generate_large_prime(bits):
    while True:
        candidate = random.getrandbits(bits)
        if candidate % 2 != 0 and pow(2, candidate - 1, candidate) == 1:
            return candidate

def encrypt(plaintext, n):
    return pow(plaintext, 2, n)

def decrypt(ciphertext, p, q, n):
    a = pow(ciphertext, (p + 1) // 4, p)
    b = pow(ciphertext, (q + 1) // 4, q)

    m1 = (mod_inverse(p, q) * a * q) % n
    m2 = (mod_inverse(q, p) * b * p) % n

    return (m1 + m2) % n

# Key generation
bits = 128  # Adjust the number of bits for prime generation
p = generate_large_prime(bits)
q = generate_large_prime(bits)
n = p * q

# Encryption
plaintext = 12345
ciphertext = encrypt(plaintext, n)

# Decryption
recovered_plaintext = decrypt(ciphertext, p, q, n)

    while (t != 1) {
        uint64_t i = 1, tt = t;
        while (tt != 1 && i < s) {
            tt = (tt * tt) % p;
            i++;

        t = (t * c) % p;

    return r;

// Function to perform Rabin encryption
uint64_t encrypt(uint64_t plaintext, uint64_t n) {
    return (plaintext * plaintext) % n;

// Function to perform Rabin decryption
uint64_t decrypt(uint64_t ciphertext, uint64_t p, uint64_t q, uint64_t n) {

int main() {
    int bits = 128;  // Adjust the number of bits for prime generation

In both the Python and C++ implementations, the Rabin cryptosystem is demonstrated, including key generation, encryption, and decryption. It's important to note that the security of the Rabin cryptosystem is partially based on the difficulty of integer factorization, which is a known hard problem. However, due to advances in factoring algorithms, the Rabin cryptos

ystem is not considered as secure as other modern encryption schemes. It's recommended to use established and well-studied encryption algorithms for secure communication.
