# Quantum Bit Commitment: Unveiling the Power of Quantum Mechanics

Quantum Bit Commitment is a cryptographic protocol that enables a party, known as the committer, to commit to a secret bit value and later reveal it to another party, known as the verifier, in a way that ensures the security and integrity of the commitment process. Unlike classical bit commitment, where commitment can be potentially altered or revealed by the committer, quantum bit commitment leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to provide an unprecedented level of security and unforgeability. In this article, we will delve into the concept, working principles, potential applications, and provide Python and C++ code examples to demonstrate Quantum Bit Commitment.

## Understanding Quantum Bit Commitment

Quantum Bit Commitment leverages the unique properties of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and uncertainty, to create an unbreakable commitment to a secret bit value. The protocol involves a series of quantum operations performed by the committer and verifier, ensuring that the committer cannot change the committed bit value after the commitment, and the verifier cannot determine the committed bit value before the reveal.

The security of Quantum Bit Commitment is rooted in the no-cloning theorem, which states that an arbitrary quantum state cannot be copied perfectly. Therefore, the committer's attempts to change the committed bit value would be detectable by the verifier due to the delicate nature of quantum states.

## The Protocol Steps

1. **Commitment Phase**:
   - The committer generates a quantum state corresponding to the secret bit value using quantum gates.
   - The committer sends the prepared quantum state to the verifier.

2. **Blinding Phase**:
   - The verifier generates a random bit value, known as the blinding bit.
   - The verifier applies a quantum operation to the received state, incorporating the blinding bit without revealing it to the committer.
   - The modified state is sent back to the committer.

3. **Reveal Phase**:
   - The committer receives the modified state and reveals the committed bit value to the verifier.
   - The verifier combines the blinding bit with the revealed bit value to obtain the committed bit.

4. **Verification Phase**:
   - The verifier applies a final quantum operation to the modified state to extract the blinding bit without affecting the committed bit value.
   - The verifier compares the extracted blinding bit with the original one to verify the consistency of the commitment.

## Example Use Cases of Quantum Bit Commitment

1. **Cryptocurrency and Transactions**: Quantum Bit Commitment can be used to create secure and verifiable cryptocurrency transactions, ensuring that transactions are genuine and irreversible.

2. **Secure Voting Systems**: Quantum Bit Commitment can contribute to building tamper-proof and transparent voting systems where voters can commit to their choices without revealing them until the appropriate time.

## Python Implementation of Quantum Bit Commitment

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
import numpy as np

class QuantumBitCommitment:
    def __init__(self, secret_bit):
        self.secret_bit = secret_bit
        self.backend = Aer.get_backend('statevector_simulator')
    
    def commit(self):
        circuit = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)
        if self.secret_bit == 1:
            circuit.x(0)
        result = execute(circuit, self.backend).result()
        statevector = result.get_statevector(circuit)
        return statevector
    
    def blind(self, statevector):
        blinding_bit = np.random.randint(0, 2)
        circuit = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)
        if blinding_bit == 1:
            circuit.x(0)
        statevector = np.dot(circuit.to_matrix(), statevector)
        result = execute(circuit, self.backend, initial_state=statevector).result()
        statevector = result.get_statevector(circuit)
        return statevector, blinding_bit
    
    def reveal(self, statevector, committed_bit):
        circuit = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)
        if committed_bit == 1:
            circuit.x(0)
        statevector = np.dot(circuit.to_matrix(), statevector)
        result = execute(circuit, self.backend, initial_state=statevector).result()
        statevector = result.get_statevector(circuit)
        return statevector
    
    def verify(self, statevector, blinding_bit):
        circuit = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)
        if blinding_bit == 1:
            circuit.x(0)
        result = execute(circuit, self.backend, initial_state=statevector).result()
        statevector = result.get_statevector(circuit)
        return np.array_equal(statevector, self.commit())

secret_bit = 0

committer = QuantumBitCommitment(secret_bit)
committed_state = committer.commit()

verifier = QuantumBitCommitment(None)
blinded_state, blinding_bit = verifier.blind(committed_state)
revealed_state = committer.reveal(blinded_state, secret_bit)
verification_result = verifier.verify(revealed_state, blinding_bit)

print("Secret Bit:", secret_bit)
print("Commitment Successful:", verification_result)
```

class QuantumBitCommitment {
public:
    QuantumBitCommitment(int secret_bit) : secret_bit(secret_bit) {
        srand(static_cast<unsigned int>(time(nullptr)));
    }

    std::vector<std::complex<double>> commit() {
        std::vector<std::complex<double>> state_vector = {1.0, 0.0};
        if (secret_bit == 1) {
            state_vector = {0.0, 1.0};
        }
        return state_vector;
    }

    std::pair<std::vector<std::complex<double>>, int> blind(const std::vector<std::complex<double>>& state_vector) {
        int blinding_bit = rand() % 2;
        std::vector<std::complex<double>> blinded_state_vector = state_vector;
        if (blinding_bit == 1) {
            applyXGate(blinded_state_vector);
        }
        return std::make_pair(blinded_state_vector, blinding_bit);
    }

    std::vector<std::complex<double>> reveal(const std::vector<std::complex<double>>& state_vector, int committed_bit) {
        std::vector<std::complex<double>> revealed_state_vector = state_vector;
        if (committed_bit == 1) {
            applyXGate(revealed_state_vector);
        }
        return revealed_state_vector;
    }

    bool verify(const std::vector<std::complex<double>>& state_vector, int blinding_bit) {
        std::vector<std::complex<double>> verification_state_vector = state_vector;
        if (blinding_bit == 1) {
            applyXGate(verification_state_vector);
        }
        return verification_state_vector == commit();
    }

private:
    int secret_bit;

    void applyXGate(std::vector<std::complex<double>>& state_vector) {
        std::swap(state_vector[0], state_vector[1]);
    }

    std::vector<std::complex<double>> commit() {
        std::vector<std::complex<double>> state_vector = {1.0, 0.0};
        if (secret_bit == 

1) {
            state_vector = {0.0, 1.0};
        }
        return state_vector;
    }
};

int main() {
    int secret_bit = 0;

    QuantumBitCommitment committer(secret_bit);
    std::vector<std::complex<double>> committed_state = committer.commit();

    QuantumBitCommitment verifier(-1); // Uninitialized
    auto blinded_state = verifier.blind(committed_state);
    auto revealed_state = committer.reveal(blinded_state.first, secret_bit);
    bool verification_result = verifier.verify(revealed_state, blinded_state.second);

    std::cout << "Secret Bit: " << secret_bit << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Commitment Successful: " << std::boolalpha << verification_result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In both the Python and C++ implementations, the Quantum Bit Commitment protocol is demonstrated. The protocol leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to ensure that a committer can commit to a secret bit value without the verifier being able to deduce the value until the reveal phase. The protocol showcases the security and unforgeability offered by quantum principles, allowing for a secure and tamper-proof commitment process.
