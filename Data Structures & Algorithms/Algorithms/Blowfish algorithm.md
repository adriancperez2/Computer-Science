Twofish is a symmetric-key block cipher algorithm designed by Bruce Schneier, John Kelsey, Doug Whiting, David Wagner, Chris Hall, and Niels Ferguson. It is a successor to the Blowfish algorithm and is known for its strong security and efficiency. Twofish operates on 128-bit blocks of data and supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.

Working of Twofish algorithm:

1. Key Expansion:
Twofish starts by expanding the user-provided key into a series of subkeys. This is done using a combination of the Feistel network and the key-dependent S-boxes. The algorithm generates four 32-bit subkeys for each round and expands the key to fill the key schedule with all necessary subkeys.

2. Encryption:
Twofish operates on a 128-bit block of plaintext using a 128, 192, or 256-bit key. The plaintext block is divided into four 32-bit blocks, referred to as A, B, C, and D. The encryption process consists of 16 rounds of Feistel network operations, each using different subkeys.

During each round, Twofish applies a combination of substitution and permutation operations to the four 32-bit blocks. These operations are based on the key-dependent S-boxes and the PHT (Partial Hadamard Transform). The result of each round is used as input to the next round.

3. Decryption:
Decryption in Twofish is the same as encryption but with the subkeys applied in reverse order. The ciphertext block is divided into four 32-bit blocks, and the Feistel network is applied in reverse, using the same subkeys.

Examples where Twofish algorithm is used:

1. Disk encryption: Twofish is used in various disk encryption applications to protect data on storage devices.

2. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): Twofish is used to secure data transmitted over VPNs to ensure confidentiality.

3. Secure messaging apps: Twofish is used in secure messaging apps to protect sensitive messages sent between users.

Python implementation of Twofish algorithm:

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import Twofish
from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes

# Generate a random 128-bit key
key = get_random_bytes(16)

# Create a Twofish cipher object with the key
cipher = Twofish.new(key)

# Encrypt a plaintext
plaintext = b'This is a secret message.'
ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(plaintext)
print("Ciphertext:", ciphertext.hex())

# Decrypt the ciphertext
decrypted_text = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)
print("Decrypted Text:", decrypted_text.decode())
```

C++ implementation of Twofish algorithm:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cryptopp/twofish.h>
#include <cryptopp/modes.h>

int main()
{
    // Generate a random 128-bit key
    CryptoPP::AutoSeededRandomPool prng;
    byte key[CryptoPP::Twofish::DEFAULT_KEYLENGTH];
    prng.GenerateBlock(key, sizeof(key));

    // Create a Twofish cipher object with the key
    CryptoPP::ECB_Mode<CryptoPP::Twofish>::Encryption e;
    e.SetKey(key, sizeof(key));

    // Encrypt a plaintext
    const char* plaintext = "This is a secret message.";
    byte ciphertext[256];
    e.ProcessData(ciphertext, (byte*)plaintext, strlen(plaintext) + 1);
    std::cout << "Ciphertext: ";
    for (size_t i = 0; i < sizeof(ciphertext); i++)
    {
        std::cout << std::hex << (int)ciphertext[i];
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // Decrypt the ciphertext
    CryptoPP::ECB_Mode<CryptoPP::Twofish>::Decryption d;
    d.SetKey(key, sizeof(key));
    byte decrypted_text[256];
    d.ProcessData(decrypted_text, ciphertext, sizeof(ciphertext));
    std::cout << "Decrypted Text: " << decrypted_text << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
