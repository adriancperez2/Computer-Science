**Linear Programming Algorithm**

Linear programming is a mathematical optimization technique used to find the best outcome in a mathematical model with linear relationships. The goal is to maximize or minimize a linear objective function while satisfying a set of linear inequality or equality constraints. Linear programming problems are widely used in various fields, such as operations research, economics, logistics, and resource allocation.

**Working of Linear Programming Algorithm**

1. **Objective Function and Constraints:**
   - Define the objective function that needs to be maximized or minimized. The objective function is a linear combination of decision variables, and the goal is to find the values of these variables that optimize the function.
   - Formulate the constraints as linear inequalities or equalities. These constraints represent the limitations or restrictions on the decision variables.

2. **Feasible Region:**
   - Graphically, the feasible region is the intersection of all the constraints in the decision variable space.
   - The feasible region is a convex polytope (bounded region) or unbounded if no constraints are present.

3. **Optimization:**
   - The linear programming algorithm explores the vertices (corner points) of the feasible region to find the optimal solution.
   - Since the objective function is linear, the optimal solution will always occur at one of the vertices.
   - The algorithm evaluates the objective function at each vertex and identifies the one that yields the maximum or minimum value.

**Example: Linear Programming Problem**

Consider a simple linear programming problem of maximizing the objective function `f(x, y) = 4x + 3y` subject to the constraints `2x + y <= 8`, `x + 2y <= 6`, `x >= 0`, and `y >= 0`.

**Python Implementation of Linear Programming using SciPy:**

```python
import scipy.optimize as opt

# Define the objective function to maximize
c = [-4, -3]

# Define the coefficient matrix of constraints
A = [[2, 1],
     [1, 2]]

# Define the right-hand side of constraints
b = [8, 6]

# Define the bounds of decision variables
x_bounds = (0, None)
y_bounds = (0, None)

# Perform linear programming optimization
result = opt.linprog(c, A_ub=A, b_ub=b, bounds=[x_bounds, y_bounds], method='simplex')

if result.success:
    print("Optimal Solution:")
    print("x =", result.x[0])
    print("y =", result.x[1])
    print("Optimal Value of Objective Function:", -result.fun)
else:
    print("Optimization failed.")
```

**C++ Implementation of Linear Programming using Google OR-Tools:**

Google OR-Tools is an open-source library for combinatorial optimization.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <ortools/linear_solver/linear_solver.h>

namespace operations_research {
void LinearProgrammingExample() {
    MPSolver solver("LinearProgrammingExample", MPSolver::GLOP_LINEAR_PROGRAMMING);

    const double infinity = solver.infinity();

    // Create variables x and y
    MPVariable* x = solver.MakeNumVar(0.0, infinity, "x");
    MPVariable* y = solver.MakeNumVar(0.0, infinity, "y");

    // Set objective function: Maximize 4x + 3y
    MPObjective* objective = solver.MutableObjective();
    objective->SetCoefficient(x, 4);
    objective->SetCoefficient(y, 3);
    objective->SetMaximization();

    // Add constraints: 2x + y <= 8 and x + 2y <= 6
    MPConstraint* constraint1 = solver.MakeRowConstraint(-infinity, 8, "c1");
    constraint1->SetCoefficient(x, 2);
    constraint1->SetCoefficient(y, 1);

    MPConstraint* constraint2 = solver.MakeRowConstraint(-infinity, 6, "c2");
    constraint2->SetCoefficient(x, 1);
    constraint2->SetCoefficient(y, 2);

    // Solve the problem
    const MPSolver::ResultStatus result_status = solver.Solve();

    // Check if the problem has an optimal solution
    if (result_status == MPSolver::OPTIMAL) {
        std::cout << "Optimal Solution:" << std::endl;
        std::cout << "x = " << x->solution_value() << std::endl;
        std::cout << "y = " << y->solution_value() << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Optimal Value of Objective Function: " << objective->Value() << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Optimization failed." << std::endl;
    }
}
}  // namespace operations_research

int main() {
    operations_research::LinearProgrammingExample();
    return 0;
}
```

In this article, we explored the linear programming algorithm used for mathematical optimization problems with linear objective functions and constraints. We provided examples of solving a linear programming problem in Python using SciPy and in C++ using Google OR-Tools. Linear programming is a powerful optimization technique used to make optimal decisions in various real-world scenarios, including resource allocation, production planning, and portfolio optimization.
