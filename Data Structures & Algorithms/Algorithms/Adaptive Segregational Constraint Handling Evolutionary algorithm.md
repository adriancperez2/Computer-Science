**Adaptive Segregational Constraint Handling Evolutionary Algorithm (ASCHEA)**

The Adaptive Segregational Constraint Handling Evolutionary Algorithm (ASCHEA) is an extension of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) designed to handle optimization problems with constraints. It aims to find solutions that not only optimize the objective function but also satisfy specified constraints. ASCHEA uses a segregation-based approach to handle constraints adaptively during the optimization process.

**Working of Adaptive Segregational Constraint Handling Evolutionary Algorithm**

The working of ASCHEA involves the following steps:

1. **Initialization:**
   - ASCHEA starts by randomly initializing a population of candidate solutions in the search space, similar to standard EAs.

2. **Evaluation:**
   - The fitness (or objective) function evaluates each candidate solution's quality by assigning a fitness value based on how well it performs in the optimization problem.
   - Higher fitness values indicate better solutions.

3. **Segregation:**
   - ASCHEA segregates the population into two groups: feasible and infeasible solutions.
   - Feasible solutions are those that satisfy the specified constraints, and infeasible solutions are those that violate the constraints.

4. **Adaptive Constraint Handling:**
   - For feasible solutions, ASCHEA applies selection, crossover, and mutation operators without any penalty.
   - For infeasible solutions, the algorithm applies constraint-handling techniques, such as penalty functions, repair methods, or constraint-domination mechanisms, to guide the search towards feasible regions.

5. **Selection, Crossover, and Mutation:**
   - After the adaptive constraint handling, the algorithm performs selection, crossover, and mutation to create new offspring.
   - The offspring population replaces the old population to form the next generation.

6. **Termination:**
   - ASCHEA repeats the segregation, adaptive constraint handling, selection, crossover, and mutation process for a specified number of generations or until a termination criterion is met (e.g., reaching a target fitness value or a maximum number of evaluations).

**Example: Using ASCHEA in Python**

As of my last update in September 2021, there is no standard implementation or library for ASCHEA in Python or C++. However, you can implement ASCHEA manually using standard Evolutionary Algorithms libraries, such as DEAP or PyEvolve, and integrate constraint handling techniques based on your specific problem.

To demonstrate the approach of adaptive constraint handling in a simple manner, we will use DEAP and implement a basic ASCHEA-like algorithm with penalty functions.

```python
import random
from deap import base, creator, tools

# Define the objective function (minimization problem)
def objective_function(x):
    return sum((x - 1) ** 2),

# Define the constraint function
def constraint_function(x):
    return sum(x) - 2.0

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a toolbox for DEAP
    creator.create("FitnessMin", base.Fitness, weights=(-1.0,))
    creator.create("Individual", list, fitness=creator.FitnessMin)

    toolbox = base.Toolbox()
    toolbox.register("attr_float", random.uniform, 0, 1)
    toolbox.register("individual", tools.initRepeat, creator.Individual, toolbox.attr_float, n=10)
    toolbox.register("population", tools.initRepeat, list, toolbox.individual)

    # Evaluation function and constraint handling
    toolbox.register("evaluate", objective_function)
    toolbox.register("feasible", lambda individual: constraint_function(individual) <= 0)

    # Penalty function for infeasible solutions
    def penalty(individual):
        return (constraint_function(individual) / 10) if not toolbox.feasible(individual) else 0.0

    toolbox.decorate("evaluate", tools.DeltaPenality(penalty))

    # Create an initial population
    population = toolbox.population(n=50)

    # Run the ASCHEA-like optimization
    for gen in range(100):
        offspring = algorithms.varAnd(population, toolbox, cxpb=0.5, mutpb=0.1)
        fits = toolbox.map(toolbox.evaluate, offspring)
        for ind, fit in zip(offspring, fits):
            ind.fitness.values = fit
        population = offspring

    # Get the best individual (solution)
    best_individual = tools.selBest(population, k=1)[0]
    best_fitness = best_individual.fitness.values[0]

    print("Optimal Solution:", best_individual)
    print("Optimal Objective Value:", best_fitness)
```

Please note that this is a basic demonstration and may not be the actual implementation of ASCHEA. The actual ASCHEA might have additional complexity and more sophisticated constraint-handling mechanisms depending on the research papers or publications related to ASCHEA.

As of my last update, there might not be a specific standard implementation of ASCHEA, and the details might vary based on different research papers. Therefore, for a more comprehensive and accurate implementation, I recommend referring to the original research papers or contacting the authors of ASCHEA for further details.
