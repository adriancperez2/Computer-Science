FEAL (Fast data Encipherment Algorithm) is a symmetric-key block cipher that was designed in the late 1980s as an alternative to the Data Encryption Standard (DES). It was developed by Akihiro Shimizu and Shoji Miyaguchi from Sony Corporation. FEAL gained some attention for its efficiency in hardware implementations, but it was later found to have security vulnerabilities and is not recommended for use in modern cryptographic applications.

**Note:** FEAL is considered insecure and is not recommended for use in any secure application. The following information is provided for educational purposes only.

## FEAL Algorithm Overview:

FEAL operates on 64-bit blocks of data and supports different key lengths, notably FEAL-4 and FEAL-NX. Here, we'll provide an overview of FEAL-4, which is the most well-known variant.

### Key Setup:
1. The algorithm takes a 128-bit key.
2. The key is divided into four 32-bit subkeys: K1, K2, K3, and K4.

### Encryption Steps (FEAL-4):
1. Initial Round:
   - XOR the plaintext with K1.
   - Apply the F-function (a Feistel network with simple bitwise operations) to the result.
   - XOR the output of the F-function with K2.

2. Round 1:
   - XOR the output of the initial round with K3.
   - Apply the F-function.
   - XOR the output of the F-function with K4.

3. Round 2:
   - XOR the output of Round 1 with K1.
   - Apply the F-function.
   - XOR the output of the F-function with K2.

4. Round 3 (Final Round):
   - XOR the output of Round 2 with K3.
   - Apply the F-function.
   - XOR the output of the F-function with K4.

5. The final output of Round 3 is the ciphertext.

### Decryption:
Decryption is achieved by applying the encryption process in reverse, using the same subkeys.

## Insecure Nature and Limited Usage:

FEAL was found to have several security vulnerabilities, including differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis attacks. Due to these vulnerabilities, FEAL is not considered secure for modern cryptographic applications.

## Code Examples (Python and C++):

As mentioned earlier, FEAL is not secure and should not be used in any practical implementation. However, for educational purposes, here's a simple example of the FEAL-4 encryption process in Python and C++. Please note that this code is not suitable for any real-world usage and is provided for illustrative purposes only.

### Python Code:

```python
def F_function(x):
    return ((x << 3) ^ (x >> 5)) & 0xFFFFFFFF

def feal_4_encrypt(plaintext, subkeys):
    left, right = plaintext >> 32, plaintext & 0xFFFFFFFF
    
    for i in range(3):
        left, right = right, left ^ F_function(right ^ subkeys[i])
    
    ciphertext = (left << 32) | right
    return ciphertext ^ subkeys[3]

key = 0x0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF
subkeys = [key >> 96, (key >> 64) & 0xFFFFFFFF, (key >> 32) & 0xFFFFFFFF, key & 0xFFFFFFFF]
plaintext = 0x123456789ABCDEF0

ciphertext = feal_4_encrypt(plaintext, subkeys)
print("Ciphertext:", hex(ciphertext))
```

### C++ Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

uint32_t F_function(uint32_t x) {
    return ((x << 3) ^ (x >> 5)) & 0xFFFFFFFF;
}

uint64_t feal_4_encrypt(uint64_t plaintext, uint32_t subkeys[4]) {
    uint32_t left = plaintext >> 32;
    uint32_t right = plaintext & 0xFFFFFFFF;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
        uint32_t temp = left;
        left = right;
        right = temp ^ F_function(right ^ subkeys[i]);
    }
    
    uint64_t ciphertext = (static_cast<uint64_t>(left) << 32) | right;
    return ciphertext ^ subkeys[3];
}

int main() {
    uint32_t key[4] = {0x01234567, 0x89ABCDEF, 0x01234567, 0x89ABCDEF};
    uint64_t plaintext = 0x123456789ABCDEF0;
    
    uint64_t ciphertext = feal_4_encrypt(plaintext, key);
    std::cout << "Ciphertext: " << std::hex << ciphertext << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

Again, please remember that FEAL is not secure and should not be used for any actual cryptographic purposes. This example is purely educational to demonstrate the basic structure of the algorithm.

**Disclaimer:** It's crucial to use established and well-reviewed cryptographic algorithms for any real-world applications, as cryptography is a highly specialized field where even a small mistake can lead to severe security vulnerabilities. Always consult with experts and use widely recognized algorithms for secure encryption.
