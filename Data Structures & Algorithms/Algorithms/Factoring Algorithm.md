**Factoring Algorithm**

Factoring is a fundamental problem in number theory that involves finding the prime factors of a given positive integer. Given an integer N, the factoring algorithm aims to decompose N into its prime factors. This problem has significant applications in cryptography, particularly in RSA encryption, where the security relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors.

**Working of Factoring Algorithm**

The factoring algorithm employs various techniques to find the prime factors of a given integer N. Some common factoring methods include:

1. **Trial Division:**
   - Trial division is the simplest factoring method and involves dividing the number N by small primes to check for divisibility.
   - The algorithm tests each potential prime divisor up to the square root of N.
   - While this method is straightforward, it becomes inefficient for very large numbers as the number of potential divisors grows rapidly.

2. **Pollard's Rho Algorithm:**
   - Pollard's Rho is a probabilistic factoring algorithm that applies the concept of cycle detection in a sequence of numbers.
   - It employs Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm and uses the concept of modular arithmetic to detect cycles in the sequence.
   - This algorithm has a faster average running time compared to trial division, but it can fail to find the factors for certain numbers.

3. **Elliptic Curve Method (ECM):**
   - ECM is a more advanced factoring algorithm based on the properties of elliptic curves over finite fields.
   - It uses point addition and multiplication on elliptic curves to search for non-trivial solutions to a specific equation.
   - ECM is one of the most efficient factoring algorithms for numbers with small to medium-sized prime factors.

4. **General Number Field Sieve (GNFS):**
   - GNFS is one of the most powerful factoring algorithms for large integers.
   - It is a complex algorithm that combines several mathematical techniques, including sieving, linear algebra, and polynomial selection.
   - GNFS is the most commonly used method for factoring large numbers encountered in modern cryptography.

**Example: Trial Division in Python and C++**

Let's implement the trial division method to find the prime factors of a given number N.

```python
def trial_division(n):
    factors = []
    # Divide by 2 until N is no longer divisible by 2
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2

    # Try odd divisors starting from 3
    divisor = 3
    while divisor * divisor <= n:
        if n % divisor == 0:
            factors.append(divisor)
            n //= divisor
        else:
            divisor += 2

    # If n is still greater than 2, it must be a prime factor
    if n > 2:
        factors.append(n)

    return factors

# Example usage
num = 84
prime_factors = trial_division(num)
print("Prime factors of", num, "are", prime_factors)
```

In this Python implementation, we use the trial division method to find the prime factors of the number 84.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> trialDivision(int n) {
    std::vector<int> factors;

    // Divide by 2 until N is no longer divisible by 2
    while (n % 2 == 0) {
        factors.push_back(2);
        n /= 2;
    }

    // Try odd divisors starting from 3
    int divisor = 3;
    while (divisor * divisor <= n) {
        if (n % divisor == 0) {
            factors.push_back(divisor);
            n /= divisor;
        } else {
            divisor += 2;
        }
    }

    // If n is still greater than 2, it must be a prime factor
    if (n > 2) {
        factors.push_back(n);
    }

    return factors;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int num = 84;
    std::vector<int> primeFactors = trialDivision(num);
    std::cout << "Prime factors of " << num << " are ";
    for (int factor : primeFactors) {
        std::cout << factor << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this C++ implementation, we also use the trial division method to find the prime factors of the number 84.
