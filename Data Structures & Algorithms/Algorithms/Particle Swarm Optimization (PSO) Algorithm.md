**Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Algorithm**

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a powerful population-based optimization algorithm inspired by the social behavior of birds flocking or fish schooling. It mimics the collective intelligence of a group of particles (agents) moving through the search space to find optimal solutions. PSO is commonly used for continuous optimization problems and has shown effectiveness in various real-world applications.

**Working of Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm**

1. **Initialization:**
   - The PSO algorithm starts by randomly initializing a population of particles in the search space. Each particle represents a potential solution to the optimization problem.
   - Each particle has a position and a velocity, which are updated in each iteration.

2. **Objective Function Evaluation:**
   - The fitness (or objective function value) of each particle's current position is evaluated.

3. **Initialization of Particle's Best Position:**
   - For each particle, its best position (the position with the best fitness value so far) is initialized with its current position.

4. **Global Best Position Initialization:**
   - The global best position (the position with the best fitness value among all particles in the swarm) is initialized based on the best position among all particles in the initial population.

5. **Velocity Update:**
   - Each particle updates its velocity using its current velocity, its best position, and the global best position.
   - The velocity update is governed by the inertia weight, cognitive (self-confidence) component, and social (swarm's best position influence) component.

6. **Position Update:**
   - Each particle updates its position using its current position and updated velocity.

7. **Local and Global Best Update:**
   - For each particle, its best position is updated if its new position leads to a better fitness value.
   - The global best position is updated if any particle finds a better position than the current global best.

8. **Termination:**
   - The algorithm repeats the velocity and position updates for a fixed number of iterations or until a convergence criterion is met.

**Example: Using Particle Swarm Optimization in Python**

Python provides several libraries for implementing the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. One such library is `pyswarm`.

```python
import numpy as np
from pyswarm import pso

def objective_function(x):
    # Example objective function (minimization problem)
    return sum((x - 1)**2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define the bounds of decision variables
    lb = np.array([0])
    ub = np.array([1])

    # Run PSO optimization
    xopt, fopt = pso(objective_function, lb, ub)

    print("Optimal Solution:", xopt[0])
    print("Optimal Objective Value:", fopt)
```

**C++ Implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization using DEAP**

Google DEAP is a versatile evolutionary computation framework that can be used for PSO.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <deap/ea/pso.h>
#include <deap/creator.h>
#include <deap/tools.h>

namespace deap = deap;

double objectiveFunction(const std::vector<double>& x) {
    // Example objective function (minimization problem)
    double sum = 0.0;
    for (const double& value : x) {
        sum += (value - 1) * (value - 1);
    }
    return sum;
}

int main() {
    // Define the evaluation function for DEAP
    deap::creator::create("FitnessMin", deap::base::Fitness, deap::base::Fitness::GetMax());
    deap::creator::create("Individual", std::vector<double>, deap::base::FitnessMin, std::vector<double>());

    deap::tools::RegisterVectorEvaluation<double>(objectiveFunction);
    deap::ea::PSO<deap::tools::DefaultIndividual>::SetParameters(10, // Population size
                                                                 100, // Maximum number of iterations
                                                                 0.5, // Inertia weight
                                                                 0.5, // Cognitive component weight
                                                                 0.5  // Social component weight
    );

    // Run PSO optimization
    deap::ea::PSO<deap::tools::DefaultIndividual> pso;

    std::vector<deap::tools::DefaultIndividual> population = pso();

    // Get the best individual (solution)
    const deap::tools::DefaultIndividual& bestIndividual = pso._hof.front();

    // Print the results
    std::cout << "Optimal Solution:";
    for (const double& value : bestIndividual) {
        std::cout << " " << value;
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    double objectiveValue = objectiveFunction(bestIndividual);
    std::cout << "Optimal Objective Value: " << objectiveValue << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this article, we explored the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, a population-based optimization technique inspired by social behavior.
