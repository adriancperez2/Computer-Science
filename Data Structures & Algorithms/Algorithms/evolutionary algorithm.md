**Evolutionary Algorithms**

Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are a class of population-based optimization algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection and evolution. EAs are widely used to solve complex optimization problems in various domains, including engineering, machine learning, economics, and more. The fundamental idea behind EAs is to mimic the process of natural selection, where better-adapted individuals (solutions) in a population are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their favorable traits to the next generation.

**Working of Evolutionary Algorithms**

The general working of Evolutionary Algorithms involves the following steps:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The algorithm starts by initializing a population of candidate solutions randomly in the search space.
   - Each candidate solution is often represented as a vector of parameters.

2. **Evaluation:**
   - The fitness (or objective) function evaluates each candidate solution's quality by assigning a fitness value based on how well it performs in the optimization problem.
   - Higher fitness values indicate better solutions.

3. **Selection:**
   - EAs use a selection mechanism to choose individuals from the population to form the basis for the next generation.
   - Individuals with higher fitness values have a higher chance of being selected, mimicking the natural selection process.

4. **Reproduction (Crossover):**
   - The selected individuals are combined through crossover (recombination) to create new offspring.
   - Crossover helps in exploring the solution space and combining beneficial traits from different parent solutions.

5. **Mutation:**
   - Mutation introduces random changes to the offspring's parameters, enabling the algorithm to explore new regions of the search space.
   - Mutation maintains diversity within the population.

6. **Replacement:**
   - The offspring population replaces the old population, ensuring that new, potentially better solutions replace weaker ones.

7. **Termination:**
   - The algorithm continues the selection, crossover, mutation, and replacement process for a specified number of generations or until a termination criterion is met (e.g., reaching a target fitness value or a maximum number of evaluations).

**Example: Using Evolutionary Algorithm in Python**

Python provides several libraries for implementing Evolutionary Algorithms. One such library is `DEAP`.

```python
import random
from deap import base, creator, tools

# Define the problem's fitness function (minimization problem)
def objective_function(individual):
    return sum(individual),

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a toolbox for DEAP
    creator.create("FitnessMin", base.Fitness, weights=(-1.0,))
    creator.create("Individual", list, fitness=creator.FitnessMin)

    toolbox = base.Toolbox()
    toolbox.register("attr_float", random.uniform, 0, 1)
    toolbox.register("individual", tools.initRepeat, creator.Individual, toolbox.attr_float, n=10)
    toolbox.register("population", tools.initRepeat, list, toolbox.individual)

    # Evaluation function and evolutionary operators
    toolbox.register("evaluate", objective_function)
    toolbox.register("mate", tools.cxBlend, alpha=0.5)
    toolbox.register("mutate", tools.mutGaussian, mu=0, sigma=0.1, indpb=0.2)
    toolbox.register("select", tools.selTournament, tournsize=3)

    # Create an initial population
    population = toolbox.population(n=50)

    # Run the Evolutionary Algorithm
    for gen in range(100):
        offspring = algorithms.varAnd(population, toolbox, cxpb=0.5, mutpb=0.1)
        fits = toolbox.map(toolbox.evaluate, offspring)
        for ind, fit in zip(offspring, fits):
            ind.fitness.values = fit
        population = toolbox.select(offspring, k=len(population))

    # Get the best individual (solution)
    best_individual = tools.selBest(population, k=1)[0]
    best_fitness = best_individual.fitness.values[0]

    print("Optimal Solution:", best_individual)
    print("Optimal Objective Value:", best_fitness)
```

**C++ Implementation of Evolutionary Algorithm using DEAP**

Google DEAP is a versatile evolutionary computation framework that can be used for implementing Evolutionary Algorithms in C++.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <deap/ea/simpleea.h>
#include <deap/creator.h>
#include <deap/tools.h>

namespace deap = deap;

double objectiveFunction(const std::vector<double>& x) {
    // Example objective function (minimization problem)
    double sum = 0.0;
    for (const double& value : x) {
        sum += (value - 1) * (value - 1);
    }
    return sum;
}

int main() {
    // Define the evaluation function for DEAP
    deap::creator::create("FitnessMin", deap::base::Fitness, deap::base::Fitness::GetMax());
    deap::creator::create("Individual", std::vector<double>, deap::base::FitnessMin, std::vector<double>());

    deap::tools::RegisterVectorEvaluation<double>(objectiveFunction);
    deap::ea::SimpleEA<deap::tools::DefaultIndividual>::SetParameters(10,  // Population size
                                                                      100, // Maximum number of iterations
                                                                      0.5, // Crossover rate
                                                                      0.1  // Mutation rate
    );

    // Run the Evolutionary Algorithm
    deap::ea::SimpleEA<deap::tools::DefaultIndividual> ea;

    std::vector<deap::tools::DefaultIndividual> population = ea();

    // Get the best individual (solution)
    const deap::tools::DefaultIndividual& best

Individual = ea._hof.front();

    // Print the results
    std::cout << "Optimal Solution:";
    for (const double& value : bestIndividual) {
        std::cout << " " << value;
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    double objectiveValue = objectiveFunction(bestIndividual);
    std::cout << "Optimal Objective Value: " << objectiveValue << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
