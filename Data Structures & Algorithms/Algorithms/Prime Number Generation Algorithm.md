**Prime Number Generation Algorithm**

Prime number generation is the process of finding prime numbers within a given range or up to a specified limit. Prime numbers are positive integers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Prime number generation is a fundamental problem in number theory and has applications in various fields, including cryptography, number theory, and computer science.

**Working of Prime Number Generation Algorithm**

There are several methods to generate prime numbers. Some commonly used prime number generation algorithms include:

1. **Brute Force:**
   - Brute force is the simplest method to generate prime numbers within a given range.
   - It involves checking each number in the range for primality by testing divisibility with all numbers less than the square root of the number.
   - While this method is straightforward, it becomes inefficient for large ranges as the number of divisions increases.

2. **Sieve of Eratosthenes:**
   - The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an efficient method to generate prime numbers up to a specified limit.
   - It works by iteratively marking multiples of each prime number as composite and preserving the unmarked numbers as prime.
   - The algorithm's time complexity is O(n log log n), making it much faster than the brute force method.

3. **Sieve of Atkin:**
   - The Sieve of Atkin is another efficient prime number generation algorithm that improves upon the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
   - It uses a set of modular arithmetic operations to mark candidates as prime or composite.
   - The Sieve of Atkin is particularly efficient for generating prime numbers in large ranges.

**Example: Sieve of Eratosthenes in Python and C++**

Let's implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate prime numbers up to a specified limit.

```python
def sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit):
    sieve = [True] * (limit + 1)
    sieve[0], sieve[1] = False, False

    for num in range(2, int(limit ** 0.5) + 1):
        if sieve[num]:
            for multiple in range(num * num, limit + 1, num):
                sieve[multiple] = False

    primes = [num for num in range(limit + 1) if sieve[num]]
    return primes

# Example usage
limit = 30
prime_numbers = sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit)
print("Prime numbers up to", limit, "are", prime_numbers)
```

In this Python implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes, we generate prime numbers up to the limit of 30.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> sieveOfEratosthenes(int limit) {
    std::vector<bool> sieve(limit + 1, true);
    sieve[0] = sieve[1] = false;

    for (int num = 2; num * num <= limit; ++num) {
        if (sieve[num]) {
            for (int multiple = num * num; multiple <= limit; multiple += num) {
                sieve[multiple] = false;
            }
        }
    }

    std::vector<int> primes;
    for (int num = 2; num <= limit; ++num) {
        if (sieve[num]) {
            primes.push_back(num);
        }
    }

    return primes;
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int limit = 30;
    std::vector<int> primeNumbers = sieveOfEratosthenes(limit);
    std::cout << "Prime numbers up to " << limit << " are ";
    for (int prime : primeNumbers) {
        std::cout << prime << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this C++ implementation, we also generate prime numbers up to the limit of 30 using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
