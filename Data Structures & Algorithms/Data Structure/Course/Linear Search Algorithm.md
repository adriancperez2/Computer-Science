### **Linear Search Algorithm**

**Linear Search** (also known as **Sequential Search**) is a simple algorithm used to find a specific element in a list or array. It works by checking each element in the list sequentially from the beginning to the end until the target element is found or the list is exhausted.

### **How Linear Search Works**

1. **Start at the first element**: Begin with the first element of the list or array.
2. **Compare with target**: Compare the current element with the target element.
3. **Element found**: If the element matches the target, return the index or position of the element.
4. **Move to the next element**: If the current element does not match, move to the next element in the list.
5. **Repeat the process**: Continue the comparison with each subsequent element until the target element is found or the entire list is searched.

If the target element is not found after checking all elements, return **not found** (usually denoted as `-1`).

### **Linear Search Algorithm (Pseudocode)**

```text
LinearSearch(array, target):
    for each index i from 0 to length of array - 1:
        if array[i] == target:
            return i  // Return the index of the target element
    return -1  // If target is not found, return -1
```

### **Example**

Consider the following array:

```
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
target = 30
```

**Step-by-Step Execution**:

1. Start at the first element, `10`. It is not equal to `30`, so move to the next element.
2. Check the second element, `20`. It is not equal to `30`, so move to the next element.
3. Check the third element, `30`. This matches the target, so return the index `2` (since indexing starts at `0`).

The output of the search would be:
```
Index of target 30: 2
```

### **Time Complexity of Linear Search**

- **Best Case**: O(1) - The target element is found at the first position.
- **Worst Case**: O(n) - The target element is either not present or found at the last position, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
- **Average Case**: O(n) - On average, you may need to check half of the elements.

So, the **overall time complexity** of Linear Search is **O(n)**, where `n` is the size of the array.

### **Space Complexity**: O(1)
Linear search does not require any additional space that grows with the input size. It only uses a constant amount of space to store the index and target value.

### **Advantages of Linear Search**
1. **Simplicity**: The algorithm is very simple to implement and understand.
2. **No need for sorting**: Unlike other search algorithms (like binary search), linear search doesnâ€™t require the array to be sorted.
3. **Works with any data structure**: Linear search works on any data structure that allows sequential access, such as arrays, lists, or linked lists.

---

### **Disadvantages of Linear Search**
1. **Inefficient for large datasets**: As the time complexity is **O(n)**, the algorithm can be slow for large datasets, especially if the element is located near the end or not present at all.
2. **Does not scale well**: Linear search does not take advantage of sorted data, unlike other searching algorithms like **binary search**, which is more efficient on sorted data (with a time complexity of **O(log n)**).

---

### **Conclusion**

Linear search is a fundamental search algorithm that is best used for small or unsorted datasets where simplicity and ease of implementation are more important than efficiency. However, for large datasets or sorted arrays, more efficient algorithms like binary search or hashing are generally preferred.
