### **Types of Queues**

Queues can be classified into different types based on their properties and usage patterns. Each type has specific characteristics and operational rules, which make them suitable for different applications. Here’s a look at the main types of queues:

---

### **1. Simple Queue (Linear Queue)**

- **Description**: This is the basic form of a queue, following the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
- **Operations**:
  - **Enqueue**: Adds elements at the rear.
  - **Dequeue**: Removes elements from the front.
- **Limitation**: Over time, space at the beginning of the queue is unused as elements are dequeued, leading to inefficient space usage.
- **Applications**: Simple queue systems like customer service lines, task scheduling.

---

### **2. Circular Queue**

- **Description**: In a circular queue, the last position is connected to the first position, forming a circular structure. This allows efficient use of space by reusing positions freed up by dequeued elements.
- **Operations**:
  - **Enqueue**: Elements are added to the rear, which wraps around to the start if the end of the queue is reached.
  - **Dequeue**: Elements are removed from the front in a similar circular manner.
- **Advantages**: Efficient space utilization, as it avoids wasted spaces from the Simple Queue.
- **Applications**: Memory management, CPU scheduling, buffering, and handling resources in a circular manner.

### **3. Priority Queue**

- **Description**: A priority queue is an abstract data type where each element has a priority. Elements are dequeued based on their priority rather than their insertion order.
- **Operations**:
  - **Enqueue**: Insert elements with associated priorities.
  - **Dequeue**: Remove elements with the highest priority first.
- **Variants**:
  - **Min Priority Queue**: Dequeues elements with the lowest priority first.
  - **Max Priority Queue**: Dequeues elements with the highest priority first.
- **Applications**: Task scheduling in operating systems, network traffic management, and managing processes in order of importance.

### **4. Double-Ended Queue (Deque)**

- **Description**: A double-ended queue, or deque, allows insertion and deletion of elements from both ends, making it flexible.
- **Operations**:
  - **Insert Front**: Adds an element to the front of the deque.
  - **Insert Rear**: Adds an element to the rear.
  - **Delete Front**: Removes an element from the front.
  - **Delete Rear**: Removes an element from the rear.
- **Types of Deques**:
  - **Input-Restricted Deque**: Only allows insertion at one end but deletion from both ends.
  - **Output-Restricted Deque**: Only allows deletion from one end but insertion at both ends.
- **Applications**: Handling undo operations, managing recent history in web browsers, and as a foundation for complex data structures.

---

### **5. Double-Ended Priority Queue**

- **Description**: Combines properties of priority queues and deques, allowing insertion and deletion from both ends while maintaining priority order.
- **Operations**:
  - **Insert**: Adds an element based on its priority.
  - **Delete Front/Rear**: Removes the element with the highest or lowest priority from either end.
- **Applications**: Use cases needing prioritized insertion and flexible retrieval, such as certain job scheduling systems and simulation systems.

---

### **6. Concurrent Queue**

- **Description**: Designed for use in concurrent applications, where multiple threads or processes need access to a shared queue.
- **Characteristics**:
  - These queues often implement **lock-free** or **thread-safe** methods to ensure data consistency.
  - Operations may include atomic enqueue and dequeue to avoid race conditions.
- **Applications**: Multithreaded applications, producer-consumer problems, concurrent task execution.

---

### **7. Input/Output Restricted Deques**

- **Description**: These are variants of the double-ended queue with restrictions on where insertion and deletion operations can occur:
  - **Input-Restricted Deque**: Allows insertion only at one end but allows deletion from both ends.
  - **Output-Restricted Deque**: Allows deletion only at one end but allows insertion from both ends.
- **Applications**: Specialized scenarios where control over insertion and deletion points is necessary, such as data pipelines and multi-stage processing systems.
