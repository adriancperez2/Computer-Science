### **Cycle Sort Algorithm**

**Cycle Sort** is an in-place, non-comparative, and unstable sorting algorithm. It is primarily used when the number of swaps is important because Cycle Sort minimizes the number of swaps needed to sort the array. The idea behind Cycle Sort is based on the concept of "cycles," where elements are placed into their correct positions by cycling them through their correct positions in the array.

Cycle Sort is especially efficient for sorting arrays with distinct elements and works well when the goal is to minimize the number of swaps.

### **How Cycle Sort Works**

The algorithm works by considering each element as part of a "cycle," which is a subset of elements that should be placed in their correct position. Instead of comparing elements as in typical sorting algorithms, Cycle Sort places an element in its correct position directly by swapping it with the element currently at that position. The algorithm proceeds by repeatedly cycling through all elements of the array.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The algorithm iterates over the elements, and for each element, it determines where it should go (i.e., its correct position) and moves it there.
   
2. **Place Element in Correct Position**:
   - The element is placed at its correct position by swapping with the element already there. If the element is already in its correct position, it does nothing.

3. **Repeat for Remaining Elements**:
   - The process repeats for the remaining unsorted elements, iterating until all elements are in their correct position.

### **Cycle Sort Algorithm (Pseudocode)**

```text
CycleSort(array):
    n = length of array
    for i = 0 to n - 2:
        item = array[i]
        
        # Find position for the current element
        pos = findPosition(array, item, i)
        
        # If element is already in the correct position, do nothing
        if pos == i:
            continue
        
        # Otherwise, place item to the correct position
        while item == array[pos]:
            pos += 1
        
        # Place item at its correct position
        Swap(array[i], array[pos])
        
        # Rotate the cycle
        while pos != i:
            pos = findPosition(array, item, i)
            while item == array[pos]:
                pos += 1
            Swap(array[i], array[pos])

findPosition(array, item, i):
    pos = i
    for j = i + 1 to n - 1:
        if array[j] < item:
            pos += 1
    return pos
```

### **Steps Explained with Example**

Let's consider an example array: `[5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]`.

1. **Initial Array**:  
   ```
   [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
   ```

2. **Step 1: First Cycle (Element `5`)**:
   - Start with `5` (at index 0). The correct position of `5` is `3`, so swap `5` and `1`.
   - Array after the swap:  
     ```
     [1, 2, 9, 5, 5, 6]
     ```

3. **Step 2: Second Cycle (Element `2`)**:
   - Move to `2`. The correct position of `2` is `1`. Since it's already in position, no change is needed.
   - Array remains:  
     ```
     [1, 2, 9, 5, 5, 6]
     ```

4. **Step 3: Third Cycle (Element `9`)**:
   - Now, consider `9`. The correct position of `9` is `4`. Swap `9` and `5`.
   - Array after the swap:  
     ```
     [1, 2, 5, 5, 9, 6]
     ```

5. **Step 4: Fourth Cycle (Element `5`)**:
   - Move to `5`. The correct position of `5` is `2`. Since it's already in position, no change is needed.
   - Array remains:  
     ```
     [1, 2, 5, 5, 9, 6]
     ```

6. **Step 5: Fifth Cycle (Element `6`)**:
   - Finally, consider `6`. The correct position of `6` is `5`, and it is already in place.
   - Array remains:  
     ```
     [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
     ```

The array is now sorted.

### **Time Complexity of Cycle Sort**

- **Best Case**: **O(n²)**: In the best case, the algorithm still needs to perform a number of comparisons and swaps that result in **O(n²)** complexity.
  
- **Worst Case**: **O(n²)**: The worst case also involves **O(n²)** comparisons and swaps.
  
- **Average Case**: **O(n²)**: Like Bubble Sort or Selection Sort, Cycle Sort has a quadratic time complexity for average cases.

### **Time Complexity Summary**:
   - Best case: **O(n²)**
   - Worst case: **O(n²)**
   - Average case: **O(n²)**

### **Space Complexity of Cycle Sort**

- **O(1)**: Cycle Sort is an **in-place** sorting algorithm, meaning it does not require any additional space other than the input array. Thus, the space complexity is constant.

### **Advantages of Cycle Sort**

1. **Minimum Number of Swaps**: Cycle Sort minimizes the number of swaps needed. It only performs a swap when an element is not in its correct position, making it ideal for scenarios where minimizing the number of swaps is crucial (e.g., for memory-constrained systems).
   
2. **In-place Sorting**: Since it is an in-place sorting algorithm, it doesn't require additional memory, making it efficient in terms of space usage.

3. **Deterministic Performance**: Cycle Sort always performs the same number of comparisons, providing predictable behavior.

---

### **Disadvantages of Cycle Sort**

1. **Inefficient for Large Arrays**: With a time complexity of **O(n²)**, Cycle Sort is inefficient for large datasets compared to other algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort, which have a time complexity of **O(n log n)**.

2. **Unstable**: Cycle Sort is not a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it may change the relative order of equal elements. This can be a problem if the stability of the sort is required.

3. **Complex to Implement**: Cycle Sort is more complex to understand and implement than other simple sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort.

---

### **Conclusion**

**Cycle Sort** is a specialized sorting algorithm designed to minimize the number of swaps, making it particularly useful when swaps are expensive (e.g., in memory-limited environments). However, its quadratic time complexity makes it inefficient for large datasets. While Cycle Sort performs well in terms of minimizing swaps, it is generally not used in practice for sorting large arrays, where more efficient algorithms like **Quick Sort** or **Merge Sort** are preferred.
