Calculating $\( f(n) \)$ typically refers to determining the **time complexity function** $\( f(n) \)$ for an algorithm, which represents how the running time (or space) grows as the input size \( n \) increases. The function \( f(n) \) describes the number of operations (or resource usage) required by the algorithm based on the input size \( n \). Below are the steps to calculate \( f(n) \) for an algorithm:

### Steps to Calculate $\( f(n) \)$ for Time Complexity:

1. **Identify the Basic Operations**:
   - The first step is to identify the basic operations in the algorithm. These operations are the core actions that the algorithm performs, such as assignments, comparisons, arithmetic operations, etc.
   - Example: In a sorting algorithm, the basic operation might be a **comparison** between two elements.

2. **Break Down the Algorithm**:
   - Break down the algorithm into **control structures** like loops, conditionals, and recursive calls.
     - **Loops**: Loops are typically the most significant factors affecting time complexity.
     - **Conditionals**: If-else conditions also impact the complexity, depending on which branch is executed.
     - **Recursion**: Recursion introduces the need to use recurrence relations to calculate the complexity.
   
3. **Count the Operations**:
   - For each part of the algorithm (loops, recursive calls, etc.), determine how many times the basic operation is executed.
     - **Single Loops**: A loop that runs \( n \) times contributes $\( O(n) \)$.
     - **Nested Loops**: A nested loop where both the outer and inner loops run \( n \) times will contribute $\( O(n^2) \)$.
     - **Recursion**: For recursive algorithms, determine how many times the function calls itself and how the input size changes in each call (often halved or reduced by a constant factor).
   
4. **Find the Recurrence Relation (for Recursion)**:
   - If the algorithm involves recursion, you will need to express the time complexity as a **recurrence relation**.
     - **Example**: MergeSort has a recurrence relation of:
       $\[
       T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)
       \]$
       where the $\( 2T(n/2) \)$ term represents the two recursive calls on halves of the input, and $\( O(n) \)$ represents the merging step.
   
5. **Simplify the Expression**:
   - After calculating the number of operations, express the total time complexity in Big-O notation by simplifying the expression, ignoring constant factors and lower-order terms.
   - For example, if you calculate $\( f(n) = 3n + 5 \)$, the time complexity is **O(n)** because the constant 5 and the coefficient 3 are ignored.

6. **Consider Best, Worst, and Average Case**:
   - **Worst-Case**: This is typically the most commonly considered time complexity. It describes the maximum number of operations the algorithm will take for any input size.
   - **Best-Case**: This is the minimum number of operations the algorithm might take for the best possible input.
   - **Average-Case**: This is the expected number of operations for typical inputs, often calculated using probability theory.

### Examples of Calculating \( f(n) \)

#### Example 1: Simple Loop
```python
def simple_loop(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):  # Loop runs n times
        print(arr[i])  # Constant time operation O(1)
```
- The loop runs \( n \) times, where \( n \) is the size of the input array.
- The operation inside the loop is a constant time operation, \( O(1) \).
- **Time Complexity**: The total number of operations is $\( n \times O(1) = O(n) \)$.
  
Thus, $\( f(n) = O(n) \)$.

#### Example 2: Nested Loops
```python
def nested_loop(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):  # Outer loop runs n times
        for j in range(len(arr)):  # Inner loop runs n times
            print(arr[i], arr[j])  # Constant time operation O(1)
```
- The outer loop runs \( n \) times, and for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop also runs \( n \) times.
- Each pair of \( i \) and \( j \) results in a constant time operation, $\( O(1) \)$.
- The total number of operations is $\( n \times n = n^2 \)$.
  
Thus, $\( f(n) = O(n^2) \)$.

#### Example 3: Binary Search (Logarithmic Time)
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
```
- The search space is halved with each iteration of the loop.
- Each iteration performs a constant time operation, $\( O(1) \)$.
- The number of iterations is proportional to \( \log n \), because with each step, the problem size is reduced by half.

Thus, $\( f(n) = O(\log n) \)$.

#### Example 4: MergeSort (Divide and Conquer)
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left = arr[:mid]
        right = arr[mid:]

        merge_sort(left)  # Recursive call on left half
        merge_sort(right)  # Recursive call on right half

        merge(left, right, arr)  # Merging step takes linear time
```
- The input is divided into two halves at each recursive call, so the number of recursive calls is proportional to $\( \log n \)$.
- The merging step takes $\( O(n) \)$ time for each level of recursion.
- **Recurrence Relation**:
  $\[
  T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)
  \]$
  Solving this using the **Master Theorem** or iterative method gives:
  $\[
  T(n) = O(n \log n)
  \]$
  
Thus, $\( f(n) = O(n \log n) \)$.

#### Example 5: A Recursive Algorithm with a Linear Operation
```python
def recursive_function(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return n + recursive_function(n - 1)
```
- This function makes a recursive call on \( n - 1 \) until \( n \) reaches 0.
- The recurrence relation is:
  $\[
  T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1)
  \]$
  Solving this gives:
  $\[
  T(n) = O(n)
  \]$
  
Thus, $\( f(n) = O(n) \)$.

### General Approach to Calculate \( f(n) \):

1. **Identify loops, recursive calls, and conditions** in the algorithm.
2. **Count the number of operations** executed for each part of the algorithm.
3. If there are **nested loops** or **recursion**, set up a **recurrence relation** and solve it.
4. **Simplify** the resulting function to its **Big-O** notation by ignoring constant factors and lower-order terms.
5. **Determine the best, worst, or average case** based on the context of the problem.

### Conclusion

To calculate $\( f(n) \)$, you must analyze the structure of the algorithm, counting the basic operations and accounting for control structures like loops and recursion. By breaking the algorithm into manageable components and solving for the total number of operations, you can express the time complexity as a function of \( n \) in Big-O notation, providing an estimate of the algorithm's efficiency as the input size grows.
