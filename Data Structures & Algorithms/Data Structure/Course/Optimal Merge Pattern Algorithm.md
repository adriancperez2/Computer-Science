### **Optimal Merge Pattern Algorithm**

The **Optimal Merge Pattern** is an algorithm used to solve the problem of combining multiple files or data sets into a single file or data set with minimal cost. The problem is typically framed as **minimizing the cost of merging files** (or other data objects) with different sizes, where the cost of merging two files is proportional to the sum of their sizes.

This problem is similar to the **Huffman coding** problem, where the goal is to construct a binary tree with the least weighted sum of all possible paths.

### **Problem Statement:**
Given **n files**, each with a specific size, we want to combine them into one file, but the merging cost between two files is proportional to their combined size. The goal is to find the optimal sequence of file merges that minimizes the total cost.

### **Steps Involved:**
1. **Greedy Approach**: Always combine the two smallest files first. This is because merging smaller files earlier minimizes the cumulative merging cost.
2. **Min-Heap or Priority Queue**: To efficiently get the two smallest files at each step, we use a **min-heap (priority queue)**.
3. **Merge Step**: After merging the two smallest files, their combined size becomes the new "merged file", which is then put back into the heap. Repeat this process until only one file remains.

### **Detailed Steps of the Algorithm:**
1. **Insert the sizes of all files** into a min-heap.
2. **Extract the two smallest files** (i.e., the two files with the smallest sizes) from the heap.
3. **Calculate the cost** of merging these two files (i.e., the sum of their sizes).
4. **Insert the new merged file** (which is the sum of the two sizes) back into the heap.
5. Repeat steps 2â€“4 until only one file remains in the heap.
6. **Total cost** is the sum of the merge costs at each step.

### **Pseudocode for Optimal Merge Pattern Algorithm:**

```python
import heapq

def optimal_merge(files):
    # Step 1: Build a min-heap from the file sizes
    heapq.heapify(files)
    
    total_cost = 0  # Initialize total cost of merging
    
    # Step 2: Repeat until there is only one file
    while len(files) > 1:
        # Extract the two smallest files
        file1 = heapq.heappop(files)
        file2 = heapq.heappop(files)
        
        # Calculate the cost of merging the two files
        merge_cost = file1 + file2
        total_cost += merge_cost
        
        # Insert the merged file back into the heap
        heapq.heappush(files, merge_cost)
    
    # Step 3: Return the total cost of merging all files
    return total_cost
```

### **Explanation of the Pseudocode:**

1. **Heapify the Files**: First, we convert the list of file sizes into a **min-heap** using Python's `heapq.heapify()`. This ensures that the smallest elements can be efficiently accessed.
   
2. **Merging Files**:
   - In each iteration, we extract the two smallest file sizes using `heapq.heappop()`. 
   - We calculate the cost of merging them (i.e., the sum of the two smallest sizes).
   - The combined size (merged file) is then pushed back into the heap using `heapq.heappush()`.
   
3. **Repeat** the process until only one file remains in the heap.

4. **Return the Total Cost**: The total cost is accumulated during the process and is returned as the final result.

### **Example of the Algorithm:**

Consider the following files with the sizes [4, 3, 2, 6]:

1. **Step 1**: Build the min-heap from the file sizes:
   - Initial heap: `[2, 3, 4, 6]`

2. **Step 2**: Extract the two smallest files (2 and 3):
   - Merge cost = 2 + 3 = 5
   - Total cost = 5
   - Insert the merged file (5) back into the heap: `[4, 5, 6]`

3. **Step 3**: Extract the two smallest files (4 and 5):
   - Merge cost = 4 + 5 = 9
   - Total cost = 5 + 9 = 14
   - Insert the merged file (9) back into the heap: `[6, 9]`

4. **Step 4**: Extract the two smallest files (6 and 9):
   - Merge cost = 6 + 9 = 15
   - Total cost = 14 + 15 = 29
   - Insert the merged file (15) back into the heap: `[15]`

5. **Step 5**: Only one file remains, so the process stops.

- **Final Total Merge Cost**: 29

### **Time Complexity:**
- **Heap Operations**:
  - Inserting an element into the heap (push operation) takes $\( O(\log n) \)$, where \( n \) is the number of files.
  - Extracting the smallest element (pop operation) also takes $\( O(\log n) \)$.
  
- Since we perform $\( n-1 \)$ merge operations (because we reduce the number of files by 1 with each merge), the overall time complexity is **O(n \log n)**, where \( n \) is the number of files.

### **Space Complexity:**
- The space complexity is **O(n)**, as we need space for the heap and the list of file sizes.

### **Applications of the Optimal Merge Pattern Algorithm:**
1. **File Merging**: Combining files in such a way as to minimize the overall cost of merging, typically used in file compression algorithms like Huffman coding.
2. **Huffman Coding**: In data compression algorithms, the Optimal Merge Pattern is used to create an optimal binary tree for encoding symbols based on their frequencies.
3. **Merging Sorted Lists**: The algorithm can also be used to efficiently merge multiple sorted lists into one sorted list, minimizing the number of comparisons.

### **Conclusion:**

The **Optimal Merge Pattern** algorithm is a greedy algorithm that efficiently merges files (or other data objects) to minimize the total merging cost. By always selecting the two smallest files to merge, it guarantees the minimum total cost, and its time complexity of \( O(n \log n) \) ensures it works efficiently for large inputs. The algorithm is widely used in various applications, including file merging and Huffman coding.
