### **Doubly Linked List**

A **doubly linked list** is a type of linked list where each node has **two pointers**:
1. **Data**: Holds the value of the node.
2. **Next**: A pointer to the next node in the sequence.
3. **Previous**: A pointer to the previous node in the sequence.

The **key difference** between a **singly linked list** and a **doubly linked list** is the **additional pointer** (previous) in a doubly linked list. This allows traversal in both directions: forward (from head to tail) and backward (from tail to head).

### **Structure of a Doubly Linked List**

Each node in a doubly linked list contains:
- **Data**: The actual value stored in the node.
- **Next**: A pointer to the next node.
- **Previous**: A pointer to the previous node.

Hereâ€™s a typical structure for a node in a doubly linked list:

```cpp
struct Node {
    int data;       // Stores the value of the node
    Node* next;     // Pointer to the next node
    Node* prev;     // Pointer to the previous node
};
```

- **Head**: A pointer that points to the first node of the list.
- **Tail**: A pointer that points to the last node of the list. The `next` pointer of the tail node is `NULL`, and the `previous` pointer of the head node is also `NULL`.

### **Operations in Doubly Linked List**

The operations in a doubly linked list are similar to those in a singly linked list, but there are extra considerations due to the additional `previous` pointer.

#### 1. **Insertion**

There are several ways to insert nodes in a doubly linked list:

##### **a) Insertion at the Beginning (Head Insertion)**

To insert at the beginning:
- Create a new node.
- Set the new node's `next` pointer to the current head.
- Set the new node's `prev` pointer to `NULL`.
- Update the head to point to the new node.
- If the list was empty, the tail should also point to the new node.

**Example (C++):**

```cpp
void insertAtHead(Node*& head, Node*& tail, int value) {
    Node* newNode = new Node;
    newNode->data = value;
    newNode->next = head;
    newNode->prev = NULL;
    
    if (head != NULL) {
        head->prev = newNode;  // Set previous head's prev pointer to new node
    }
    head = newNode;  // Move head to new node

    if (tail == NULL) {
        tail = newNode;  // If the list was empty, the tail also points to the new node
    }
}
```

##### **b) Insertion at the End (Tail Insertion)**

To insert at the end:
- Traverse to the last node (tail).
- Set the last node's `next` pointer to the new node.
- Set the new node's `prev` pointer to the previous tail node.
- Update the tail to point to the new node.

**Example (C++):**

```cpp
void insertAtEnd(Node*& head, Node*& tail, int value) {
    Node* newNode = new Node;
    newNode->data = value;
    newNode->next = NULL;
    newNode->prev = tail;
    
    if (tail != NULL) {
        tail->next = newNode;  // Set the old tail's next pointer to the new node
    }
    tail = newNode;  // Move tail to the new node
    
    if (head == NULL) {
        head = newNode;  // If the list was empty, the head also points to the new node
    }
}
```

##### **c) Insertion at a Specific Position**

To insert at a specific position:
- Traverse to the desired position.
- Update the `next` and `prev` pointers of the neighboring nodes accordingly.

**Example (C++):**

```cpp
void insertAtPosition(Node*& head, Node*& tail, int value, int position) {
    if (position == 0) {
        insertAtHead(head, tail, value);
        return;
    }

    Node* newNode = new Node;
    newNode->data = value;
    
    Node* temp = head;
    for (int i = 0; i < position - 1 && temp != NULL; i++) {
        temp = temp->next;
    }

    if (temp != NULL) {
        newNode->next = temp->next;
        newNode->prev = temp;
        
        if (temp->next != NULL) {
            temp->next->prev = newNode;
        }
        temp->next = newNode;
        
        if (newNode->next == NULL) {  // If inserted at the end
            tail = newNode;
        }
    }
}
```

#### 2. **Deletion**

There are several types of deletion in a doubly linked list:

##### **a) Deletion from the Beginning**

To delete the node at the beginning:
- Update the head to point to the second node.
- Set the `prev` pointer of the new head to `NULL`.

**Example (C++):**

```cpp
void deleteFromHead(Node*& head, Node*& tail) {
    if (head == NULL) return;  // List is empty
    
    Node* temp = head;
    head = head->next;  // Move head to the next node
    if (head != NULL) {
        head->prev = NULL;  // Set the new head's prev pointer to NULL
    }
    delete temp;
    
    if (head == NULL) {  // If the list becomes empty
        tail = NULL;
    }
}
```

##### **b) Deletion from the End**

To delete from the end:
- Update the tail to point to the second-last node.
- Set the `next` pointer of the new tail to `NULL`.

**Example (C++):**

```cpp
void deleteFromEnd(Node*& head, Node*& tail) {
    if (tail == NULL) return;  // List is empty
    
    Node* temp = tail;
    tail = tail->prev;  // Move tail to the previous node
    if (tail != NULL) {
        tail->next = NULL;  // Set the new tail's next pointer to NULL
    }
    delete temp;
    
    if (tail == NULL) {  // If the list becomes empty
        head = NULL;
    }
}
```

##### **c) Deletion of a Specific Node**

To delete a specific node:
- Find the node.
- Adjust the `next` and `prev` pointers of the neighboring nodes.

**Example (C++):**

```cpp
void deleteNode(Node*& head, Node*& tail, int value) {
    if (head == NULL) return;  // List is empty

    Node* temp = head;
    while (temp != NULL && temp->data != value) {
        temp = temp->next;
    }

    if (temp != NULL) {  // Node found
        if (temp->prev != NULL) {
            temp->prev->next = temp->next;  // Adjust the previous node's next pointer
        } else {
            head = temp->next;  // If it's the head node
        }
        
        if (temp->next != NULL) {
            temp->next->prev = temp->prev;  // Adjust the next node's prev pointer
        } else {
            tail = temp->prev;  // If it's the tail node
        }

        delete temp;
    }
}
```

#### 3. **Traversal**

In a doubly linked list, you can traverse both forward and backward.

##### **a) Forward Traversal**

To traverse from head to tail:

```cpp
void printForward(Node* head) {
    Node* temp = head;
    while (temp != NULL) {
        cout << temp->data << " ";
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

##### **b) Backward Traversal**

To traverse from tail to head:

```cpp
void printBackward(Node* tail) {
    Node* temp = tail;
    while (temp != NULL) {
        cout << temp->data << " ";
        temp = temp->prev;
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

### **Advantages of Doubly Linked Lists**

1. **Bidirectional Traversal**: Can be traversed in both directions (forward and backward), unlike singly linked lists.
2. **Efficient Deletion**: Deletion of a node (even in the middle) is more efficient because we have direct access to the previous node.
3. **Flexibility**: Insertion and deletion at both ends (head and tail) can be done in constant time, making the doubly linked list more versatile.

---

### **Disadvantages of Doubly Linked Lists**

1. **Extra Memory**: Each node requires additional memory for the `prev` pointer, increasing memory overhead compared to singly linked lists.
2. **Complexity**: Managing two pointers (`next` and `prev`) increases the complexity of operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
3. **Slower Insertion and Deletion in Certain Cases**: While insertion and deletion at the beginning or end are efficient, handling pointer updates in the middle of the list can be slightly more complex.

### **Applications of Doubly Linked Lists**

1. **Browser History**: Doubly linked lists can be used to implement

 the forward and backward navigation of a web browser.
2. **Undo and Redo Operations**: In applications that require undo and redo functionality (like text editors), doubly linked lists can maintain the state of operations in both directions.
3. **Memory Management**: Doubly linked lists are often used in memory management systems where memory blocks need to be linked and accessed in both directions.

---

### **Conclusion**

A **doubly linked list** is a powerful data structure that allows for efficient traversal in both directions. It provides advantages over singly linked lists in terms of ease of deletion and bidirectional traversal, but at the cost of extra memory usage. Understanding and implementing doubly linked lists can significantly enhance your ability to solve complex data structure problems.
