### **Linked List Implementation of Stack**

A **linked list** implementation of a stack provides a dynamic structure that can grow or shrink in size as needed. Unlike an array-based stack, a linked list-based stack does not have a fixed size, eliminating the risk of overflow (unless memory is exhausted).

### **Structure of Stack Using Linked List**

In a linked list-based stack:
- Each element in the stack is represented by a **node** containing:
  - `data`: The actual value.
  - `next`: A pointer to the next node in the stack.
- The **top** pointer points to the topmost node in the stack.

### **Basic Operations in a Linked List Stack**

1. **Push**: Insert a new node at the top of the stack.
2. **Pop**: Remove the top node from the stack.
3. **Peek**: Retrieve the value of the top node without removing it.
4. **isEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty.

### **Code Implementation in C++**

Here's a sample implementation of a stack using a linked list in C++.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class StackNode {
public:
    int data;
    StackNode* next;

    StackNode(int data) {
        this->data = data;
        next = nullptr;
    }
};

class Stack {
    StackNode* top;  // Pointer to the top of the stack

public:
    Stack() { top = nullptr; }  // Constructor initializes stack as empty

    // Push operation
    void push(int data) {
        StackNode* newNode = new StackNode(data);  // Create a new node
        newNode->next = top;  // Link new node to the current top
        top = newNode;  // Update top to the new node
        std::cout << data << " pushed into stack\n";
    }

    // Pop operation
    int pop() {
        if (isEmpty()) {  // Check if the stack is empty
            std::cout << "Stack Underflow\n";
            return 0;
        }
        StackNode* temp = top;  // Store the current top node
        top = top->next;  // Move top to the next node
        int popped = temp->data;  // Get the data of the node to pop
        delete temp;  // Delete the popped node
        return popped;
    }

    // Peek operation
    int peek() {
        if (isEmpty()) {  // Check if the stack is empty
            std::cout << "Stack is Empty\n";
            return 0;
        }
        return top->data;  // Return the data of the top node
    }

    // Check if the stack is empty
    bool isEmpty() {
        return top == nullptr;
    }
};
```

### **Explanation of Operations**

1. **Push Operation**
   - Create a new node with the given data.
   - Link the new node to the current `top`.
   - Update `top` to point to the new node.

2. **Pop Operation**
   - Check if the stack is empty; if it is, print an underflow message.
   - Otherwise, store the top node in a temporary variable, move `top` to the next node, retrieve the data of the popped node, delete the temporary node, and return the popped value.

3. **Peek Operation**
   - If the stack is empty, return a message indicating so.
   - Otherwise, return the data of the `top` node without modifying the stack.

4. **isEmpty Operation**
   - Check if `top` is `nullptr`, indicating the stack is empty.

### **Example Usage**

```cpp
int main() {
    Stack stack;

    stack.push(10);
    stack.push(20);
    stack.push(30);

    std::cout << stack.pop() << " popped from stack\n";  // Should print "30 popped from stack"
    std::cout << "Top element is " << stack.peek() << "\n";  // Should print "Top element is 20"
    std::cout << "Stack is " << (stack.isEmpty() ? "empty" : "not empty") << "\n";  // Should print "Stack is not empty"

    return 0;
}
```

### **Advantages of Linked List-Based Stack**

1. **Dynamic Size**: Can grow or shrink as needed without predefined size.
2. **Efficient Memory Usage**: No memory is wasted, as each node is allocated as needed.

### **Disadvantages of Linked List-Based Stack**

1. **Memory Overhead**: Each element requires additional memory for the pointer to the next node.
2. **More Complex than Array-Based**: Requires dynamic memory allocation, which can slow down performance compared to array-based stacks in some cases.

### **Conclusion**

A linked list-based stack is an efficient solution when a flexible, dynamically sized stack is required. It avoids overflow issues inherent to array-based stacks, making it suitable for applications with variable storage needs. This implementation is particularly useful for scenarios requiring dynamic memory, such as recursion management, parsing expressions, and backtracking.
