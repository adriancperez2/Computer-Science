### **Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm**

**Depth-First Search (DFS)** is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It starts at a root node and explores as deeply as possible down each path before retreating and exploring the next path. DFS is widely used in graph traversal, pathfinding, and tree structure analysis.

---

### **How DFS Works**

1. **Start at the root node (or source node)**: The DFS algorithm starts at a specific node, marking it as visited.
2. **Explore each branch deeply**: From the current node, move to an unvisited adjacent node and continue the process.
3. **Backtrack when necessary**: If no unvisited adjacent nodes are available, backtrack to the most recent node that has unvisited neighbors, and continue the search.
4. **Mark nodes as visited**: To avoid revisiting the same node, it is marked as visited.

DFS can be implemented using either recursion or an explicit stack. The recursive approach is easier to implement, while the stack-based approach mimics the recursion mechanism.

---

### **DFS Algorithm (Pseudocode)**

Here’s the pseudocode for the DFS algorithm:

```text
DFS(Graph, start_vertex):
    create a stack S
    push start_vertex onto S
    mark start_vertex as visited
    while S is not empty:
        vertex = pop from S
        visit vertex  // Process the current node
        for each adjacent vertex v of vertex:
            if v is not visited:
                mark v as visited
                push v onto S
```

Alternatively, the recursive version of DFS can be written as:

```text
DFS(Graph, vertex):
    mark vertex as visited
    visit vertex  // Process the current node
    for each adjacent vertex v of vertex:
        if v is not visited:
            DFS(Graph, v)
```

### **DFS Example**

Let’s go through an example to understand how DFS works.

#### Example Graph:

```
     A
    / \
   B   C
   |   |
   D - E
```

- Starting from node **A**, the DFS algorithm will visit the nodes along one path before backtracking.

#### Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **Start at A**:
   - Stack: [A]
   - Visit A.
   - Push A’s neighbors (B and C) onto the stack.

2. **Visit B (top of the stack)**:
   - Stack: [C, B]
   - Visit B.
   - Push B’s neighbor (D) onto the stack.

3. **Visit D (top of the stack)**:
   - Stack: [C, D]
   - Visit D.
   - D has no unvisited neighbors, so we backtrack.

4. **Backtrack to B**:
   - Stack: [C]
   - B has no more unvisited neighbors, so we backtrack to A.

5. **Backtrack to A**:
   - Stack: []
   - A has no more unvisited neighbors (C was already visited), so we backtrack.

6. **Visit C**:
   - Stack: [C]
   - Visit C.
   - Push C’s neighbor (E) onto the stack.

7. **Visit E (top of the stack)**:
   - Stack: [E]
   - Visit E.
   - E has no unvisited neighbors, so we backtrack.

#### DFS Traversal Order:
The DFS traversal order starting from vertex **A** would be:
- **A → B → D → C → E**

### **DFS Implementation in Python**

Here’s a Python implementation of DFS using an adjacency list representation of the graph.

#### **Recursive DFS Implementation:**

```python
def dfs_recursive(graph, vertex, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()  # Set to track visited nodes
    visited.add(vertex)  # Mark the current node as visited
    print(vertex, end=" ")  # Process the current node
    
    # Recurse for all the unvisited neighbors of the current node
    for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs_recursive(graph, neighbor, visited)

# Example graph representation as an adjacency list
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D'],
    'C': ['A', 'E'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['C']
}

# Call DFS starting from vertex 'A'
dfs_recursive(graph, 'A')
```

**Output:**
```
A B D C E
```

#### **Iterative DFS Implementation (using a stack):**

```python
def dfs_iterative(graph, start):
    visited = set()  # Set to track visited nodes
    stack = [start]  # Initialize the stack with the start node
    
    while stack:
        vertex = stack.pop()  # Pop the top node from the stack
        if vertex not in visited:
            visited.add(vertex)  # Mark it as visited
            print(vertex, end=" ")  # Process the current node
            # Push all unvisited neighbors onto the stack
            stack.extend(neighbor for neighbor in graph[vertex] if neighbor not in visited)

# Call DFS starting from vertex 'A'
dfs_iterative(graph, 'A')
```

**Output:**
```
A C E B D
```

### **Time Complexity of DFS**

- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E)
  - **V** is the number of vertices in the graph.
  - **E** is the number of edges in the graph.
  - Each vertex is visited once, and each edge is considered once when checking the neighbors of a vertex.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(V)
  - The space complexity is proportional to the number of vertices because of the storage needed for the visited set (or stack in iterative DFS).

---

### **Applications of DFS**

DFS is used in various applications, including:

1. **Pathfinding**: DFS can be used to find a path between two nodes, though it is not guaranteed to find the shortest path.
2. **Cycle Detection**: DFS is commonly used to detect cycles in both directed and undirected graphs.
3. **Topological Sorting**: DFS can be used in **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)** to perform topological sorting (ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge \( u \to v \), vertex \( u \) comes before \( v \)).
4. **Connected Components**: DFS is used to find connected components in an undirected graph.
5. **Solving Puzzles**: DFS is useful for solving puzzles like mazes and games (e.g., finding all possible configurations of a problem space).
6. **Tree Traversals**: DFS forms the basis for tree traversal algorithms such as **preorder**, **inorder**, and **postorder**.

### **DFS vs BFS**

- **DFS** is better for:
  - Finding a path between two nodes.
  - Solving problems where the solution requires exploring all possible paths.
  - Problems like topological sorting, finding strongly connected components, etc.

- **BFS** is better for:
  - Finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
  - Problems where you need to explore all nodes at the current level before moving to the next level.

DFS and BFS have their specific use cases, and the choice between them depends on the problem being solved.

### **Conclusion**

DFS is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm that explores as deeply as possible into a graph before backtracking. It can be implemented using recursion or an explicit stack. DFS is versatile and used in applications like pathfinding, cycle detection, topological sorting, and tree traversal. Its time and space complexity depend on the number of vertices and edges in the graph, making it an efficient algorithm for large-scale problems.
