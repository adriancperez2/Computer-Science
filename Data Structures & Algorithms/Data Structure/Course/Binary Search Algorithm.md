### **Binary Search Algorithm**

**Binary Search** is an efficient searching algorithm used to find the position of a target element in a **sorted array** (or list). Unlike linear search, which checks each element sequentially, binary search repeatedly divides the search interval in half, significantly reducing the number of comparisons needed.

### **How Binary Search Works**

1. **Start with the middle element**: Begin by comparing the target value with the middle element of the sorted array.
2. **Divide the array**: If the target is equal to the middle element, the search is over, and the index of the middle element is returned.
3. **Check which half to search**:
   - If the target is smaller than the middle element, the search continues on the left half of the array.
   - If the target is larger than the middle element, the search continues on the right half of the array.
4. **Repeat the process**: The process repeats with the chosen half of the array, cutting the search space in half each time.
5. **Terminate if not found**: If the search space becomes empty (i.e., the start index exceeds the end index), the target element is not present, and the algorithm returns **not found**.

### **Binary Search Algorithm (Pseudocode)**

```text
BinarySearch(array, target):
    left = 0
    right = length of array - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        middle = (left + right) // 2
        if array[middle] == target:
            return middle  // Return the index if the target is found
        elif array[middle] < target:
            left = middle + 1  // Search in the right half
        else:
            right = middle - 1  // Search in the left half
    
    return -1  // Target not found
```

### **Example of Binary Search**

Consider the sorted array:

```
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]
target = 50
```

**Step-by-Step Execution**:

1. **Initial values**: `left = 0`, `right = 8` (since there are 9 elements).
2. **Middle element**: `middle = (0 + 8) // 2 = 4`. The element at index 4 is `arr[4] = 50`, which matches the target value.
3. Since the target value is found at index 4, return `4`.

Output:
```
Index of target 50: 4
```

### **Time Complexity of Binary Search**

- **Best Case**: O(1) - The target element is found at the middle in the first comparison.
- **Worst Case**: O(log n) - Each comparison cuts the search space in half. The algorithm performs logarithmic comparisons in the worst case, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
- **Average Case**: O(log n) - In most cases, binary search will find the target element in a logarithmic number of comparisons.

Thus, the **overall time complexity** of Binary Search is **O(log n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

### **Space Complexity**: O(1) (Iterative Approach)
Binary search only requires a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the size of the input array, since it only needs a few pointers (left, right, middle).

### **Binary Search Variants**

1. **Iterative Binary Search**:
   This is the most common implementation, where the search space is adjusted using a loop.
   
2. **Recursive Binary Search**:
   This version uses recursion to narrow down the search space instead of using a loop.

**Recursive Binary Search Algorithm (Pseudocode)**:
```text
BinarySearchRecursive(array, target, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return -1  // Target not found

    middle = (left + right) // 2
    if array[middle] == target:
        return middle
    elif array[middle] < target:
        return BinarySearchRecursive(array, target, middle + 1, right)
    else:
        return BinarySearchRecursive(array, target, left, middle - 1)
```

### **Applications of Binary Search**

1. **Searching in Sorted Arrays**: The most common use of binary search is to search for an element in a sorted array or list. It is significantly faster than linear search for large datasets.
   
2. **Efficient Searching in Databases**: Binary search is often used in databases for searching large tables and indexed data.

3. **Range Queries**: In some problems, binary search is used to find a value within a specified range (for example, finding the smallest or largest value that satisfies a condition).

4. **Finding Boundaries**: Binary search can be used to find the boundary of a set of elements, such as the first or last occurrence of an element in a sorted array.

### **Advantages of Binary Search**

1. **Efficiency**: Binary search is much faster than linear search, especially for large datasets, due to its **O(log n)** time complexity.
   
2. **Simple**: The algorithm is easy to implement, whether iteratively or recursively.

3. **Predictable performance**: The worst-case time complexity is always **O(log n)**, making the algorithm predictable in terms of performance.

### **Disadvantages of Binary Search**

1. **Requires Sorted Data**: Binary search can only be applied to sorted arrays. If the data is not sorted, it must first be sorted, which can take additional time (O(n log n) using algorithms like quicksort or mergesort).

2. **Overhead for small datasets**: For very small datasets, binary search might be overkill compared to simpler algorithms like linear search, which can be more efficient in practice due to constant factors.

### **Conclusion**

Binary search is an efficient and widely used algorithm for searching in sorted arrays or lists. It significantly reduces the number of comparisons needed compared to linear search, making it suitable for large datasets. With its **O(log n)** time complexity, binary search is often preferred for searching operations in applications like databases, file systems, and many computational problems that require quick lookups in sorted data.
