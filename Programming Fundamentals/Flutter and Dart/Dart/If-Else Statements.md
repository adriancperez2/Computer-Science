In Dart, `if-else` statements are used to make decisions based on conditions. They allow you to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition evaluates to `true` or `false`. This control flow structure is fundamental for implementing logic in your programs. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of how to use `if-else` statements in Dart, along with examples.

### 1. **Basic Syntax of If-Else Statements**

The basic structure of an `if-else` statement in Dart is as follows:

```dart
if (condition) {
  // Code to execute if the condition is true
} else {
  // Code to execute if the condition is false
}
```

### 2. **Usage Examples**

#### Simple If Statement

The simplest form of an `if` statement executes a block of code if the condition is true.

```dart
void main() {
  int age = 20;

  if (age >= 18) {
    print('You are an adult.'); // Output: You are an adult.
  }
}
```

#### If-Else Statement

An `if-else` statement allows you to execute one block of code if the condition is true and another block if it is false.

```dart
void main() {
  int age = 16;

  if (age >= 18) {
    print('You are an adult.');
  } else {
    print('You are a minor.'); // Output: You are a minor.
  }
}
```

#### If-Else If-Else Ladder

You can use multiple `if` and `else if` statements to test multiple conditions. The first condition that evaluates to `true` will execute its corresponding block of code.

```dart
void main() {
  int score = 85;

  if (score >= 90) {
    print('Grade: A');
  } else if (score >= 80) {
    print('Grade: B'); // Output: Grade: B
  } else if (score >= 70) {
    print('Grade: C');
  } else {
    print('Grade: D or F');
  }
}
```

### 3. **Nested If Statements**

You can nest `if` statements within other `if` statements to create more complex decision-making structures.

```dart
void main() {
  int age = 20;
  bool hasLicense = true;

  if (age >= 18) {
    if (hasLicense) {
      print('You can drive.'); // Output: You can drive.
    } else {
      print('You need a driving license to drive.');
    }
  } else {
    print('You are not old enough to drive.');
  }
}
```

### 4. **Using Logical Operators with If Statements**

You can combine conditions using logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) to form more complex conditions in your `if` statements.

```dart
void main() {
  int age = 25;
  bool hasPermission = false;

  if (age >= 18 && hasPermission) {
    print('Access granted.');
  } else {
    print('Access denied.'); // Output: Access denied.
  }
}
```

### 5. **Conclusion**

`If-else` statements are essential for controlling the flow of your Dart programs based on conditions. They allow you to implement logic that can adapt to different situations, making your code dynamic and responsive. Understanding how to effectively use `if`, `else`, and `else if` statements is crucial for writing clear and efficient Dart code, enabling you to build applications that respond correctly to user input and other variables.
