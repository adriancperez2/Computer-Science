Perl and CGI (Common Gateway Interface) are technologies that were historically used together to create dynamic web applications. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

**Perl**

1. Perl is a high-level, general-purpose programming language, known for its text-processing capabilities, flexibility, and support for regular expressions.
2. It was commonly used in web development, especially in the 1990s and early 2000s, before other technologies like PHP, JavaScript, and Python gained more prominence.


**CGI (Common Gateway Interface)**

1. CGI is a standard protocol used to enable communication between a web server and external programs (scripts). It allows web servers to run scripts and programs in response to client requests.
2. CGI scripts can be written in various languages, including Perl, Python, C, or even Bash.
