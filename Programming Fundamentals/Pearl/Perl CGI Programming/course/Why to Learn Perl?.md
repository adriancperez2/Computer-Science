Learning Perl can still be valuable, even though its popularity has declined in modern web development. Here are several reasons why you might want to learn Perl:

### 1. **Text Processing and Regular Expressions**  
   - **Text Manipulation**: Perl is often called the "Swiss Army knife" of programming languages because of its exceptional capabilities in text manipulation. If your work involves parsing logs, processing strings, or dealing with complex text processing tasks, Perl remains a strong choice.
   - **Regular Expressions**: Perl has some of the most powerful built-in regular expression support, and learning Perl can help you understand and use regex more effectively in other languages.

### 2. **Legacy Systems**  
   - **Maintaining Existing Systems**: Many legacy systems, especially in fields like finance, bioinformatics, and telecommunications, were built using Perl. If you're working with or maintaining such systems, knowing Perl is essential for troubleshooting, upgrading, and modifying existing code.
   - **Perl-Based Infrastructure**: Some infrastructure and automation tools still rely on Perl, such as older data processing pipelines and web applications.

### 3. **System Administration and Scripting**  
   - **Automation**: Perl is widely used for writing scripts that automate system administration tasks like file management, log parsing, and monitoring server activity.
   - **Command-Line Tools**: Perl is effective for writing small utilities and scripts for the command line, handling system tasks or data transformations that might otherwise require more complex programming.

### 4. **CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network)**  
   - **Access to Libraries**: CPAN is one of Perl’s most powerful features. It's a repository of thousands of Perl modules that can handle a wide range of tasks, from web development to databases to networking and beyond.
   - **Rapid Development**: By leveraging CPAN, you can quickly implement complex features without reinventing the wheel.

### 5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**  
   - **Works Across Platforms**: Perl is cross-platform and works seamlessly on Windows, Linux, and macOS. This makes it ideal for writing scripts that need to run on multiple operating systems without modification.

### 6. **Robust Community and Documentation**  
   - **Perl’s Community**: While Perl's community is not as large as some newer languages, it is passionate and well-established. The community maintains extensive documentation, forums, and resources for learning.
   - **Comprehensive Documentation**: Perl’s built-in documentation (accessible via `perldoc`) is extensive and covers nearly every aspect of the language, making it relatively easy to learn and troubleshoot.

### 7. **Data Science and Bioinformatics**  
   - **Bioinformatics**: Perl has been a popular language in bioinformatics for tasks like DNA sequence processing, data extraction, and manipulation.
   - **Data Parsing**: Perl's built-in capabilities for handling structured data formats (like CSV, JSON, and XML) make it a useful tool for working with data files.

### 8. **Fast Prototyping**  
   - **Scripting and Prototyping**: Perl's concise syntax allows developers to quickly prototype and build scripts or applications without having to worry about extensive boilerplate code.
   - **Rapid Development**: If you need to get a small program or automation tool up and running quickly, Perl’s succinct syntax and built-in functionality make it a great choice.

### 9. **Network Programming**  
   - **Socket Programming**: Perl’s extensive libraries for networking, such as handling HTTP requests, working with FTP, and managing sockets, can be beneficial for writing networked applications.
   - **Web Scraping**: Perl has robust libraries for scraping and parsing web pages, making it useful for tasks like web scraping and automating data extraction.

### 10. **Learning the Language Improves Programming Skills**  
   - **Understanding Programming Concepts**: Perl encourages a flexible, yet disciplined approach to coding, which can help improve your understanding of other languages.
   - **Exposure to Different Paradigms**: Perl supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming, so learning Perl can broaden your understanding of programming styles.

### 11. **Niche Career Opportunities**  
   - **Niche Job Market**: While Perl isn't as widely used as other modern languages, there are still niche job opportunities for those who are skilled in Perl, particularly in the fields of data engineering, bioinformatics, system administration, and network programming.

### 12. **It’s Fun and Flexible**  
   - **Expressive Syntax**: Many Perl programmers enjoy the expressive, "write-only" nature of the language, where complex operations can often be done with just a few lines of code. It encourages creative solutions, which can be rewarding to explore.

### Conclusion:  
Although Perl may not be the first language that comes to mind for modern software development, it offers significant advantages in certain niches such as text processing, system scripting, and working with legacy codebases. If you work in fields like bioinformatics, system administration, or data manipulation, or if you need to maintain old code, learning Perl could still be a very useful skill.
