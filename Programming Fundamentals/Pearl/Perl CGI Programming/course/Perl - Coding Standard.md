### Perl - Coding Standard

Adhering to a coding standard is essential in Perl, as it enhances code readability, maintainability, and reduces the likelihood of errors. Perl’s flexible syntax makes coding standards particularly valuable, as they provide consistency in code style and practices across teams and projects.

---

### 1. **General Code Structure**

- **File Headers**: Include a descriptive comment header at the top of each file with details such as the script’s purpose, author, and last modification date.
  
  ```perl
  # File: my_script.pl
  # Purpose: Process data and generate report
  # Author: John Doe
  # Date: 2024-11-13
  ```

- **Module Usage**: Always start scripts with essential modules like `strict` and `warnings`, which help catch common mistakes.

  ```perl
  use strict;
  use warnings;
  ```

- **Function Organization**: Group functions by purpose and place high-level functions at the top, so the flow of the code is easy to follow.

---

### 2. **Variable Naming and Scope**

- **Descriptive Names**: Use descriptive variable names that clarify the purpose of each variable. Avoid single-letter variable names unless in simple loops.

  ```perl
  my $total_cost = 0;  # Good
  my $tc = 0;          # Avoid
  ```

- **Scope Management**: Use `my` to declare variables in the smallest scope possible to avoid unintended interactions. Minimize the use of global variables.

  ```perl
  my $value = 10;  # Scoped within the block or subroutine
  ```

- **Constants**: Declare constants using uppercase variable names and the `constant` pragma when appropriate.

  ```perl
  use constant PI => 3.14159;
  ```

---

### 3. **Indentation and Spacing**

- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces per indentation level; avoid tabs. This ensures consistent indentation regardless of the editor settings.
  
  ```perl
  if ($condition) {
      print "Condition met\n";
  }
  ```

- **Spacing Around Operators**: Place spaces around operators for readability.

  ```perl
  my $sum = $a + $b;
  ```

- **Blank Lines**: Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code, such as between variable declarations, blocks, or function definitions.

---

### 4. **Subroutines**

- **Naming**: Use descriptive names for subroutines. Function names should reflect their action or purpose, e.g., `process_data`, `calculate_sum`.

- **Parameter Passing**: Pass parameters to subroutines through `@_` and avoid using global variables. If a subroutine has many parameters, consider using a hash to improve readability.

  ```perl
  sub calculate_total {
      my ($price, $quantity) = @_;
      return $price * $quantity;
  }
  ```

- **Return Values**: Explicitly return values from subroutines rather than relying on the last evaluated expression.

  ```perl
  sub get_discounted_price {
      my ($price, $discount) = @_;
      return $price - ($price * $discount);
  }
  ```

---

### 5. **Error Handling**

- **Use `die` and `warn`**: Always check for potential errors, particularly with file I/O or system calls, and provide informative messages.

  ```perl
  open(my $fh, "<", "data.txt") or die "Cannot open data.txt: $!";
  ```

- **`eval` Blocks for Exception Handling**: Use `eval` blocks for error handling in code that may throw exceptions, checking `$@` afterward for errors.

  ```perl
  eval {
      some_function();
  };
  warn "Error encountered: $@" if $@;
  ```

---

### 6. **Control Structures**

- **Curly Braces**: Always use curly braces with control structures (`if`, `while`, `for`), even if only one statement follows, to prevent errors.

  ```perl
  if ($condition) {
      print "Condition met\n";
  }
  ```

- **`elsif` and `else`**: Use `elsif` and `else` for readability instead of nested `if` statements. Place each conditional on its own line.

  ```perl
  if ($value == 1) {
      print "One\n";
  } elsif ($value == 2) {
      print "Two\n";
  } else {
      print "Other\n";
  }
  ```

- **Short-Circuit Operators**: Use `and` and `or` for control flow when appropriate for readability, especially with `die` and `warn`.

  ```perl
  open(my $fh, "<", "data.txt") or die "Cannot open file: $!";
  ```

---

### 7. **Comments and Documentation**

- **Inline Comments**: Use inline comments sparingly, and only when the code’s purpose isn’t immediately clear.

  ```perl
  my $total = $price * $quantity;  # Calculate total cost
  ```

- **Block Comments**: Use block comments for complex logic, explaining the purpose of the code and its intended behavior.

- **Perl POD (Plain Old Documentation)**: For scripts and modules, use POD for detailed documentation. This can be used to create user manuals or API documentation.

  ```perl
  =head1 NAME

  MyScript - Example Perl Script

  =head1 SYNOPSIS

  my_script.pl [options]

  =cut
  ```

---

### 8. **Regular Expressions**

- **Clarity Over Conciseness**: Write regular expressions with clarity in mind. Use comments and the `/x` modifier to space out complex expressions.

  ```perl
  my $phone_pattern = qr/
      ^                 # Start of string
      \(\d{3}\)         # Area code in parentheses
      \s\d{3}-\d{4}     # Main number with dash
      $                 # End of string
  /x;
  ```

- **Capturing Groups**: Use capturing groups only when necessary; prefer non-capturing groups `(?:...)` if the group is only for grouping, not capturing.

---

### 9. **File and Directory Handling**

- **Always Check File Operations**: Check the result of file operations (`open`, `close`, `read`, `write`) and handle errors appropriately.

- **Explicitly Close Filehandles**: Although Perl automatically closes filehandles at the end of a program, explicitly closing filehandles is a good practice.

  ```perl
  open(my $fh, "<", "file.txt") or die "Cannot open file: $!";
  close($fh) or warn "Cannot close file: $!";
  ```

---

### 10. **Code Testing and Linting**

- **Use `perlcritic`**: `perlcritic` is a static code analysis tool for Perl that can catch syntax errors, stylistic inconsistencies, and possible bugs.

- **Write Tests**: Use Perl’s testing modules like `Test::Simple` or `Test::More` to create test scripts for functions or modules. Regular testing ensures code correctness and helps in maintenance.

  ```perl
  use Test::More tests => 2;

  is(calculate_total(10, 2), 20, 'Calculate total works');
  ok(-e "data.txt", 'data.txt exists');
  ```

| **Error Handling**         | Use `die`, `warn`, and `eval` for robust error handling.                                     |
| **Control Structures**     | Use braces for all control structures and check conditions explicitly.                       |
| **Documentation**          | Use comments and POD documentation for clarity.                                              |
| **Regular Expressions**    | Use `/x` for complex regex, and non-capturing groups when applicable.                        |
| **Testing and Linting**    | Use `perlcritic` for code quality and write unit tests with `Test::More`.                    |

Following these standards ensures that Perl code is clean, maintainable, and accessible to other developers.
