### Perl - Special Variables

Perl has numerous special variables that hold important values used in various contexts, like system error messages, default values, or matched patterns. These variables often have symbolic names (e.g., `$!`, `$_`) and are crucial for writing concise and effective Perl scripts. Here is an overview of some of Perl's commonly used special variables.

---

### 1. **`$_` - Default Variable**

The `$_` variable is the default for many functions, and it stores the value of the current line or input when none is specified explicitly.

#### Example

```perl
while (<STDIN>) {
    chomp;           # `chomp $_` by default
    print "You entered: $_\n";
}
```

In this example, `$_` stores each line of input.

---

### 2. **`$@` - Error Messages from `eval`**

When `eval` is used to trap exceptions, `$@` holds any error message.

#### Example

```perl
eval { die "Error occurred"; };
print "Error: $@" if $@;
```

If an error occurs within `eval`, `$@` contains the error message.

---

### 3. **`$!` - System Error Messages**

`$!` provides system-related error messages, typically used after a failed file operation.

#### Example

```perl
open(my $fh, "<", "nonexistent_file.txt") or die "Cannot open file: $!";
```

If the file cannot be opened, `$!` contains the system error message.

---

### 4. **`$.` - Current Line Number**

The `$.` variable keeps track of the line number for the last filehandle read operation. It is useful for tracking progress in file processing.

#### Example

```perl
open(my $fh, "<", "file.txt") or die $!;
while (<$fh>) {
    print "Line $.: $_";
}
close($fh);
```

The line number (`$.`) resets when a filehandle is closed and reused.

---

### 5. **`$^O` - Operating System**

The `$^O` variable contains the name of the operating system Perl is running on.

#### Example

```perl
print "OS: $^O\n";
```

This can be helpful when writing cross-platform scripts that need to adjust behavior based on the OS.

---

### 6. **`$?` - Status of Last System Command**

The `$?` variable stores the exit status of the last executed external command.

#### Example

```perl
system("ls");
print "Exit status: $?\n";
```

The value is 0 if the command executed successfully; otherwise, it is non-zero.

---

### 7. **`$|` - Output Buffering**

The `$|` variable controls whether Perl flushes output to a filehandle immediately (setting `$| = 1`) or buffers it (default is `$| = 0`). Setting `$|` to `1` is helpful in real-time logging and console output.

#### Example

```perl
$| = 1;  # Enable autoflush
print "Processing...\n";
```

When `$|` is set to `1`, output appears immediately, rather than being buffered.

---

### 8. **`$^T` - Script Start Time**

`$^T` stores the time at which the script started. It is often used with `time` to calculate elapsed time.

#### Example

```perl
my $elapsed_time = time - $^T;
print "Elapsed time: $elapsed_time seconds\n";
```

---

### 9. **`@ARGV` - Command-Line Arguments**

`@ARGV` is an array that contains command-line arguments passed to the script.

#### Example

```perl
foreach my $arg (@ARGV) {
    print "Argument: $arg\n";
}
```

If you run the script with `perl script.pl arg1 arg2`, `@ARGV` will contain `("arg1", "arg2")`.

---

### 10. **`@_` - Subroutine Parameters**

Within a subroutine, `@_` holds the arguments passed to it. This array allows you to access each argument by index.

#### Example

```perl
sub greet {
    my ($name) = @_;
    print "Hello, $name!\n";
}

greet("Alice");
```

In this case, `@_` contains `"Alice"`, which is assigned to `$name`.

---

### 11. **`%ENV` - Environment Variables**

`%ENV` is a hash that contains the environment variables for the current process.

#### Example

```perl
print "PATH: $ENV{PATH}\n";
```

This code prints the value of the `PATH` environment variable.

---

### 12. **`$<`, `$>`, `$(`, `$)` - User and Group IDs**

- **`$<`**: Real user ID.
- **`$>`**: Effective user ID.
- **`$(`**: Real group ID.
- **`$)`**: Effective group ID.

These are used in scripts that require user permissions.

#### Example

```perl
print "Real user ID: $<, Effective user ID: $>\n";
```

---

### 13. **`$0` - Script Name**

`$0` contains the name of the script being executed. This is useful for displaying script usage or debugging output.

#### Example

```perl
print "Script name: $0\n";
```

---

### 14. **`$[`, `$]` - Array Base Index**

The `$[` variable is obsolete but was once used to set the base index for arrays (default is 0). `$]` holds the Perl version and is often used for compatibility checks.

#### Example

```perl
print "Perl version: $]\n";
```
