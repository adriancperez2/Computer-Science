In Rust, you can shadow functions by redeclaring them in the same scope. Function shadowing occurs when you define a new function with the same name as an existing function, effectively "hiding" the original function. This can be useful for testing or modifying the behavior of a function temporarily within a specific scope.

Here's an example of function shadowing:

```rust
fn greet(name: &str) {
    println!("Hello, {}!", name);
}

fn main() {
    greet("Alice"); // Invokes the original 'greet' function

    // Shadow the 'greet' function with a new implementation
    fn greet(name: &str) {
        println!("Hi, {}!", name);
    }

    greet("Bob"); // Invokes the shadowed 'greet' function
}
```

In this example, the `greet` function is defined twice. The second definition within the `main` function shadows the original `greet` function. When calling `greet("Bob")`, the shadowed function is invoked, printing "Hi, Bob!" instead of "Hello, Bob!".

Function shadowing is a powerful feature that allows you to temporarily modify the behavior of functions within a specific scope without affecting the global behavior of the program. Keep in mind that shadowing should be used judiciously and with clear intent, as it can lead to confusion if overused or misapplied.
