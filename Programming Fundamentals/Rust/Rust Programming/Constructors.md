In Rust, structs do not have traditional constructors like in some other programming languages. Instead, you can achieve similar functionality by providing associated functions that create and initialize instances of the struct. These associated functions are often referred to as "constructor" functions.

Here's how you can define and use constructor functions in Rust:

```rust
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
}

impl Person {
    // Constructor function
    fn new(name: &str, age: u32) -> Person {
        Person {
            name: String::from(name),
            age,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Using the constructor function
    let person = Person::new("Alice", 30);
    println!("Name: {}, Age: {}", person.name, person.age);
}
```

In this example, we define a `Person` struct and provide a constructor function `new` that takes parameters for the `name` and `age` fields and returns a new instance of the `Person` struct with the specified values.

To call the constructor function, you use the associated function syntax, providing the required parameters:

```rust
let person = Person::new("Alice", 30);
```

By using constructor functions, you encapsulate the process of creating and initializing struct instances, promoting code organization and reusability.

Additionally, Rust provides a shorthand syntax called field init shorthand that allows you to use parameter names that match struct field names:

```rust
impl Person {
    fn new(name: &str, age: u32) -> Person {
        Person {
            name: String::from(name),
            age,
        }
    }
}
```

This simplifies the initialization code:

```rust
let person = Person::new("Alice", 30);
```

While Rust's approach to constructors is different from some other languages, it aligns well with Rust's ownership and borrowing principles, contributing to safe and efficient code.
