If you want to combine literal strings (string literals) in Rust, you can use the `+` operator to concatenate them. However, it's important to note that the `+` operator performs string concatenation on owned strings (`String` type), not on string slices (`&str` type). Here's how you can combine string literals:

```rust
fn main() {
    let first_name = "John";
    let last_name = "Doe";

    let full_name = first_name.to_string() + " " + last_name;
    println!("Full Name: {}", full_name);
}
```

In this example, the `+` operator is used to concatenate the first name, a space, and the last name, creating a new `String` containing the full name.

If you want to concatenate string slices directly without converting them to `String` objects, you can use the `format!` macro:

```rust
fn main() {
    let first_name = "John";
    let last_name = "Doe";

    let full_name = format!("{} {}", first_name, last_name);
    println!("Full Name: {}", full_name);
}
```

The `format!` macro allows you to create a formatted string by providing placeholders `{}` that correspond to the values you want to insert. It returns a new `String` containing the formatted text.

Remember that the `format!` macro is often preferred because it's more flexible and doesn't require ownership changes. If you're dealing with a combination of literals and variables, the `format!` macro is a safer and more idiomatic choice.

Keep in mind that Rust's ownership rules are designed to prevent certain common programming errors, so make sure to consider ownership and borrowing when working with strings.
