In Rust, you can define mutating methods on structs using the `&mut self` parameter. Mutating methods allow you to modify the internal state of a struct. When a method takes `&mut self` as a parameter, it means that it is allowed to modify the object it's called on.

Here's how you can define and use mutating methods in Rust:

```rust
struct Counter {
    count: i32,
}

impl Counter {
    // Mutating method to increment the counter
    fn increment(&mut self) {
        self.count += 1;
    }

    // Mutating method to reset the counter
    fn reset(&mut self) {
        self.count = 0;
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut counter = Counter { count: 0 };

    counter.increment();
    counter.increment();
    println!("Counter: {}", counter.count); // Output: Counter: 2

    counter.reset();
    println!("Counter after reset: {}", counter.count); // Output: Counter after reset: 0
}
```

In this example, we define a `Counter` struct with two mutating methods: `increment` and `reset`. These methods take a mutable reference to `self` (`&mut self`) as a parameter. This allows them to modify the `count` field of the struct.

To call a mutating method on a mutable object, you need to use the `mut` keyword when declaring the object. This signals to Rust that you intend to modify the object's state.

```rust
let mut counter = Counter { count: 0 };
counter.increment();
```

By using the `&mut self` parameter in mutating methods, Rust ensures that there is only one mutable reference to the object at a time, preventing data races and ensuring memory safety.
