Processing text files in Rust involves reading and manipulating the content of the file using the `std::fs` and `std::io` modules from the standard library. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to read and process text files in Rust:

1. **Opening a Text File**:

   To open a text file, use the `File::open()` function from the `std::fs` module. This function returns a `Result<File, io::Error>`.

   ```rust
   use std::fs::File;
   use std::io::{self, BufRead};

   fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
       let file = File::open("input.txt")?;
       // Process the file
       Ok(())
   }
   ```

2. **Reading Line by Line**:

   To read the contents of the file line by line, use the `BufReader` and `lines()` methods from the `std::io` module.

   ```rust
   use std::fs::File;
   use std::io::{self, BufRead, BufReader};

   fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
       let file = File::open("input.txt")?;
       let reader = BufReader::new(file);

       for line in reader.lines() {
           println!("{}", line?);
       }

       Ok(())
   }
   ```

3. **Processing Lines**:

   You can process each line as you read it. For example, split lines into words using the `split_whitespace()` method:

   ```rust
   use std::fs::File;
   use std::io::{self, BufRead, BufReader};

   fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
       let file = File::open("input.txt")?;
       let reader = BufReader::new(file);

       for line in reader.lines() {
           let line = line?;
           let words: Vec<&str> = line.split_whitespace().collect();
           println!("Number of words: {}", words.len());
       }

       Ok(())
   }
   ```

4. **Writing to a New File**:

   If you want to process the input and write the results to a new file, you can use the `File::create()` function to create a new file for writing.

   ```rust
   use std::fs::{File, OpenOptions};
   use std::io::{self, BufRead, BufReader, Write};

   fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
       let input_file = File::open("input.txt")?;
       let reader = BufReader::new(input_file);

       let output_file = OpenOptions::new()
           .write(true)
           .create(true)
           .open("output.txt")?;

       let mut writer = io::BufWriter::new(output_file);

       for line in reader.lines() {
           let line = line?;
           let uppercased = line.to_uppercase();
           writeln!(writer, "{}", uppercased)?;
       }

       Ok(())
   }
   ```

Remember to handle errors appropriately using the `Result` type and the `?` operator for concise error handling. The examples provided demonstrate basic text file processing operations. Depending on your specific needs, you can perform more complex operations and data manipulations on the text file content.
