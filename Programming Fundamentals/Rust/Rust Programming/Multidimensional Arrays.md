Rust doesn't have true multidimensional arrays like some other programming languages. Instead, Rust provides arrays and arrays of arrays, which can be used to achieve similar effects.

For example, you can create an "array of arrays" to represent a 2D structure:

```rust
fn main() {
    let matrix: [[i32; 3]; 2] = [
        [1, 2, 3],
        [4, 5, 6],
    ];

    println!("Matrix[0][0]: {}", matrix[0][0]);
    println!("Matrix[1][2]: {}", matrix[1][2]);
}
```

In this example, `matrix` is an array of two arrays, each containing three `i32` elements. The first index specifies the row, and the second index specifies the column.

You can also create arrays of arrays of arrays to represent higher-dimensional structures:

```rust
fn main() {
    let tensor: [[[i32; 3]; 2]; 2] = [
        [
            [1, 2, 3],
            [4, 5, 6],
        ],
        [
            [7, 8, 9],
            [10, 11, 12],
        ],
    ];

    println!("Tensor[0][0][0]: {}", tensor[0][0][0]);
    println!("Tensor[1][1][2]: {}", tensor[1][1][2]);
}
```

In practice, when dealing with more complex data structures or matrices, it's often more flexible and ergonomic to use Rust's `Vec` (vector) type and nested vectors, as they provide dynamic sizing and better support for multidimensional data.

```rust
fn main() {
    let matrix: Vec<Vec<i32>> = vec![
        vec![1, 2, 3],
        vec![4, 5, 6],
    ];

    println!("Matrix[0][0]: {}", matrix[0][0]);
    println!("Matrix[1][2]: {}", matrix[1][2]);
}
```

Remember that multidimensional arrays, especially nested arrays, can become less efficient and harder to work with compared to using vectors or other data structures, especially when dealing with dynamic sizing or larger amounts of data.
