In Rust, you can return a value from a function using the `return` keyword followed by the value you want to return. The value's type should match the return type specified in the function's signature. If the value you want to return is the last expression in the function, you can also omit the `return` keyword.

Here's how you can define a function that returns a value and how to call that function to retrieve the returned value:

```rust
// Define a function named 'add' that takes two 'i32' arguments and returns the sum
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    let sum = a + b;
    sum // 'return' keyword can be omitted here
}

fn main() {
    let result = add(10, 20);
    println!("Result: {}", result);
}
```

In this example, the `add` function takes two `i32` arguments and returns their sum. The `return` keyword is omitted because the last expression in the function (`sum`) is the value to be returned.

You can also use the `return` keyword explicitly:

```rust
fn subtract(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    return a - b;
}

fn main() {
    let result = subtract(30, 15);
    println!("Result: {}", result);
}
```

In this example, the `subtract` function takes two `i32` arguments and returns their difference using the `return` keyword.

Returning a value from a function allows you to communicate computed results back to the caller. The value returned from the function can be used in expressions or assigned to variables in the calling code.
