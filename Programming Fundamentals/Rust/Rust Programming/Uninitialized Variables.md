In Rust, uninitialized variables are not allowed. Rust enforces strict safety rules to prevent the use of uninitialized variables, as they can lead to undefined behavior, security vulnerabilities, and hard-to-debug issues.

When you declare a variable in Rust, it must always be initialized before it is used. This ensures that you're working with valid and predictable data at all times. Attempting to use an uninitialized variable will result in a compile-time error.

Here's an example of how Rust enforces initialization:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Uncommenting the line below will result in a compilation error
    // let x: i32;

    let y: i32 = 42;
    println!("Value of y: {}", y);
}
```

In the example above, the line `let x: i32;` is commented out, but if you were to uncomment it, you would receive a compilation error indicating that the variable `x` is uninitialized.

To initialize a variable, you need to provide a value when you declare it, like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 10;
    println!("Value of x: {}", x);
}
```

By enforcing initialization, Rust helps prevent many common programming errors and contributes to the language's strong emphasis on safety and reliability.
