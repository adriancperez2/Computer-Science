In Rust, memory allocation is managed through a combination of stack and heap memory, providing a balance between performance and safety. Rust's ownership and borrowing system, along with its smart pointers, ensure that memory is managed correctly without manual memory management or the risk of memory leaks.

Here are some ways to allocate memory in Rust:

1. **Stack Allocation**: Rust allocates memory on the stack for local variables with a known, fixed size. Stack allocation is fast and efficient but is limited to variables with a static size determined at compile time.

   ```rust
   fn main() {
       let x: i32 = 42; // Allocated on the stack
       // ...
   }
   ```

2. **Heap Allocation**: Rust provides dynamic memory allocation on the heap through smart pointers like `Box<T>`, `Vec<T>`, and other collection types. These types handle memory allocation and deallocation automatically.

   ```rust
   fn main() {
       let boxed_value: Box<i32> = Box::new(42); // Allocated on the heap
       let vec: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3]; // Allocated on the heap
       // ...
   }
   ```

3. **Allocating Dynamic Memory**: If you need more control over memory allocation, you can use the `alloc` module from the standard library, which provides functions like `alloc` and `dealloc`.

   ```rust
   use std::alloc::{alloc, dealloc, Layout};

   fn main() {
       let layout = Layout::new::<i32>();
       let ptr = unsafe { alloc(layout) as *mut i32 };
       // ...
       unsafe {
           dealloc(ptr as *mut u8, layout);
       }
   }
   ```

It's important to note that Rust's ownership and borrowing rules ensure that memory is managed safely, avoiding common issues like null pointers, buffer overflows, and dangling pointers. The compiler enforces these rules at compile time, reducing the risk of runtime errors related to memory allocation.

In most cases, you'll use Rust's high-level abstractions like `Box`, `Vec`, and other collection types, which handle memory allocation and deallocation for you. If you need more control over memory allocation, you can use the `alloc` module or explore third-party libraries that provide specialized memory management facilities.
