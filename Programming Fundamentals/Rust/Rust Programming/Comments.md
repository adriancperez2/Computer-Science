Comments in Rust are used to add explanatory or descriptive text to your code. They are ignored by the compiler and have no impact on the behavior of the program. Comments are a helpful way to document your code, explain your thought process, and make your code more understandable for yourself and others.

Rust supports two types of comments:

1. **Line Comments**: Line comments start with `//` and continue until the end of the line.

```rust
fn main() {
    // This is a line comment
    println!("Hello, World!"); // This comment follows a statement
}
```

2. **Block Comments**: Block comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. They can span multiple lines.

```rust
fn main() {
    /* This is a block comment.
     * It can span multiple lines.
     * Block comments are often used for larger explanations.
     */
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

It's good practice to use comments to explain your code's purpose, document function signatures, clarify complex logic, and provide context for your decisions. Here are some examples:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Declare a variable to store the user's age
    let age: i32 = 30;

    // Check if the user is a teenager (age between 13 and 19)
    if age >= 13 && age <= 19 {
        println!("You're a teenager!");
    } else {
        println!("You're not a teenager.");
    }
}
```

```rust
/// Calculates the sum of two integers.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `a` - The first integer.
/// * `b` - The second integer.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// The sum of `a` and `b`.
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

fn main() {
    let result = add(5, 7);
    println!("Result: {}", result);
}
```

In the second example, you can see how comments are used to create documentation comments (also known as doc comments) for the `add` function. These comments follow a specific format and can be used to automatically generate documentation using tools like `rustdoc`.

Effective use of comments can greatly enhance the readability and maintainability of your codebase. However, strive to write self-explanatory code whenever possible, so comments are used to complement understanding rather than replace it.
