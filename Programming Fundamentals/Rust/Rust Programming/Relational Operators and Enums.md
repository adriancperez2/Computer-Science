Relational operators in Rust (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) can be used to compare values of types that implement the `PartialEq` and `PartialOrd` traits. Enums can be compared using these operators as long as their variants are comparable.

Here's how you can use relational operators with enums:

```rust
#[derive(PartialEq, PartialOrd)]
enum OrderStatus {
    Pending,
    Shipped,
    Delivered,
}

fn main() {
    let order1 = OrderStatus::Shipped;
    let order2 = OrderStatus::Delivered;

    if order1 == order2 {
        println!("Both orders have the same status.");
    } else {
        println!("Orders have different statuses.");
    }

    if order1 < order2 {
        println!("Order 1 was shipped before Order 2 was delivered.");
    } else {
        println!("Order 1 was not shipped before Order 2 was delivered.");
    }
}
```

In this example, we've derived the `PartialEq` and `PartialOrd` traits for the `OrderStatus` enum. This allows us to compare enum variants using the relational operators. The `PartialEq` trait enables equality comparisons (`==` and `!=`), while the `PartialOrd` trait enables ordering comparisons (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`).

If you have an enum with associated data (tuple or struct variants), the associated data must also implement the necessary traits for the enum to be comparable using relational operators.

Keep in mind that for custom types or enums without the `PartialEq` and `PartialOrd` traits derived, you can manually implement these traits to enable custom comparison behavior.
