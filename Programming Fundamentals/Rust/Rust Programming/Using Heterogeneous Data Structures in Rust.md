Rust's type system enforces strict compile-time checks, which means that truly heterogeneous data structures (containing elements of different, unrelated types) are generally not directly supported. However, you can achieve a form of heterogeneity using enums and trait objects.

1. **Enums**:

   Enums can hold a variety of data types through their variants, allowing you to create a form of heterogeneity. This is often used to represent a set of related options.

   ```rust
   enum Data {
       Integer(i32),
       Float(f64),
       Text(String),
   }

   fn main() {
       let data_list: Vec<Data> = vec![
           Data::Integer(42),
           Data::Float(3.14),
           Data::Text(String::from("Hello")),
       ];

       for item in &data_list {
           match item {
               Data::Integer(num) => println!("Integer: {}", num),
               Data::Float(val) => println!("Float: {}", val),
               Data::Text(txt) => println!("Text: {}", txt),
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Trait Objects**:

   Trait objects allow you to create collections of types that implement a certain trait. This provides a level of heterogeneity by allowing you to work with different types that share a common trait.

   ```rust
   trait Printable {
       fn print(&self);
   }

   struct Integer(i32);
   struct Text(String);

   impl Printable for Integer {
       fn print(&self) {
           println!("Integer: {}", self.0);
       }
   }

   impl Printable for Text {
       fn print(&self) {
           println!("Text: {}", self.0);
       }
   }

   fn main() {
       let items: Vec<Box<dyn Printable>> = vec![
           Box::new(Integer(42)),
           Box::new(Text(String::from("Hello"))),
       ];

       for item in &items {
           item.print();
       }
   }
   ```

In this example, we define a trait `Printable` that provides a method `print()`. We implement this trait for two different types, `Integer` and `Text`. Then, we use a vector of trait objects to hold instances of these types and call the `print()` method on each.

Keep in mind that while Rust provides ways to work with heterogeneity, the type system still enforces safety and prevents runtime errors. The examples above demonstrate ways to achieve a form of heterogeneity while respecting Rust's strong typing and safety guarantees.
