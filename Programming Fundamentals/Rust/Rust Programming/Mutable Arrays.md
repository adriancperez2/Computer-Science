In Rust, you can create arrays of a specified size by providing both the element type and the fixed size as part of the array type's definition. Arrays in Rust have a fixed size that is determined at compile time and cannot change during runtime.

Here's how you can create arrays of a specified size in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Create an array of integers with a size of 3
    let numbers: [i32; 3] = [1, 2, 3];

    // Access elements of the array
    println!("Number at index 0: {}", numbers[0]);
    println!("Number at index 1: {}", numbers[1]);
    println!("Number at index 2: {}", numbers[2]);
}
```

In this example, we've created an array named `numbers` of type `[i32; 3]`, indicating that it holds `i32` (32-bit signed integer) elements and has a fixed size of 3.

Keep in mind the following when working with arrays of specified size:

1. The size of the array is fixed and determined at compile time. Once the size is set, it cannot be changed during runtime.
2. The array elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.
3. Rust provides bounds checking for array indexing to prevent buffer overflows and out-of-bounds access.

If you need a collection that can dynamically grow or shrink at runtime, you should consider using Rust's `Vec` (vector) type, which is a dynamically sized container. Arrays are best suited for scenarios where you know the exact size of the data in advance and don't need to resize it dynamically.
