In Rust, variables are immutable by default, meaning once a value is assigned to a variable, you can't change it. However, you can make a variable mutable by using the `mut` keyword. This allows you to modify the value associated with the variable after its initial assignment.

Here's how you declare and use mutable variables in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Declare an immutable variable
    let x = 5;

    // Declare a mutable variable
    let mut y = 10;

    // Modify the value of the mutable variable
    y = y + 1;

    println!("x: {}", x);
    println!("y: {}", y);
}
```

In this example, the variable `x` is immutable, so you can't change its value after it's assigned. On the other hand, the variable `y` is mutable, allowing you to modify its value using the `mut` keyword.

Remember that mutability is a powerful feature, but it also comes with responsibilities. When using mutable variables, you need to be cautious about data races, concurrent access, and potential bugs that could arise from modifying the same data from multiple places simultaneously. Rust's ownership system and borrow checker help prevent many of these issues and ensure safe concurrent programming.
