In Rust, you can define functions after their use. This is possible because Rust performs a forward pass through the source code, allowing you to reference functions that are defined later in the file. This approach is often referred to as "forward declaration" or "forward referencing."

Here's an example of defining a function after its use:

```rust
fn main() {
    greet("Alice");
}

fn greet(name: &str) {
    println!("Hello, {}!", name);
}
```

In this example, the `greet` function is defined after it's invoked within the `main` function. Rust's compiler is able to understand the references and resolve them during the compilation process.

This behavior makes it convenient to structure your code in a way that logically separates functions while still allowing you to call them in a logical order.

However, keep in mind that if you're calling a function that is defined in a different module or file, you might need to use proper module or file organization and make sure that the function is accessible within the scope where it's called.

Overall, Rust's forward referencing feature allows you to write code in a more natural and intuitive order while maintaining proper function call and definition relationships.
