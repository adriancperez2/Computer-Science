In Rust, closures are a powerful feature that allows you to define anonymous functions or code blocks that can capture and manipulate variables from their surrounding environment. Closures provide a way to create flexible and reusable blocks of code that can be passed around as arguments or returned from functions.

Here's how you can define closures in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Define a closure that adds two numbers
    let add = |a, b| a + b;

    let result = add(10, 20);
    println!("Result: {}", result);

    // Closures can also capture variables from the environment
    let base = 5;
    let multiply = |x| x * base;

    let result = multiply(3);
    println!("Result: {}", result);
}
```

In this example, we define two closures: `add` and `multiply`. The `add` closure takes two arguments and returns their sum. The `multiply` closure takes one argument and multiplies it by the `base` variable captured from the environment.

Closures are flexible and can have different forms:

1. **Anonymous Functions**: Closures can take arguments and have a body just like regular functions.

2. **Capture Environment**: Closures can capture variables from the surrounding environment, allowing you to use those variables within the closure's body.

3. **Move Semantics**: Closures can capture variables by reference or by value. By default, they capture variables by reference, but you can use the `move` keyword to capture variables by value.

4. **Type Inference**: Rust's type inference allows you to write closures without specifying the argument types, as long as their types can be inferred from how they are used.

Closures are often used in Rust for tasks like sorting, filtering, mapping, and more. They are a key tool for creating expressive and concise code, especially when working with iterators and higher-order functions in Rust's standard library.
