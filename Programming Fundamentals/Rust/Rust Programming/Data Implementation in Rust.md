In Rust, data is implemented using a combination of basic data types, custom structs, enums, and collections. Rust's strong typing and ownership system ensure memory safety and prevent common programming errors related to data manipulation.

Here's an overview of how data can be implemented in Rust:

1. **Basic Data Types**: Rust provides a set of built-in basic data types, including integers (`i32`, `u64`, etc.), floating-point numbers (`f32`, `f64`), characters (`char`), booleans (`bool`), and more. These types are used to represent simple data values.

2. **Structs**: Structs allow you to define custom data structures by grouping together multiple fields of different types. Structs provide a way to model real-world entities and encapsulate related data.

   ```rust
   struct Person {
       name: String,
       age: u32,
   }

   let person = Person {
       name: String::from("Alice"),
       age: 30,
   };
   ```

3. **Enums**: Enums define a type that can have multiple variants. Each variant can optionally hold associated data. Enums are useful for representing different states or options.

   ```rust
   enum TrafficLight {
       Red,
       Yellow,
       Green,
   }

   let light = TrafficLight::Red;
   ```

4. **Custom Data Types**: By combining structs and enums, you can create more complex custom data types that accurately represent the data and behavior of your application.

5. **Collections**: Rust provides several collection types, such as vectors, arrays, linked lists, and hash maps, which allow you to store and manipulate multiple values.

   ```rust
   let numbers: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   ```

6. **Generics**: Generics enable you to write code that works with different types. They allow you to create data structures and functions that are reusable across multiple data types.

   ```rust
   fn print_all<T>(items: Vec<T>) {
       for item in items {
           println!("{:?}", item);
       }
   }
   ```

7. **Traits and Implementations**: Traits define shared behavior that types can implement. You can use traits to define common functionality for different data types.

   ```rust
   trait Printable {
       fn print(&self);
   }

   impl Printable for i32 {
       fn print(&self) {
           println!("Value: {}", self);
       }
   }
   ```

Rust's ownership and borrowing system ensures that data is managed safely and efficiently, preventing issues like data races and memory leaks. Additionally, Rust's pattern matching, destructuring, and associated functions provide powerful tools for working with data.

Overall, Rust provides a robust and expressive way to implement data structures and manipulate data while maintaining a high level of safety and performance.
