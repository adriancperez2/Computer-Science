Boolean values and expressions in Rust are used to represent logical conditions and make decisions in your code. Boolean values can be either `true` or `false`, and boolean expressions are used to evaluate conditions that determine the flow of your program.

Here's how you can work with boolean values and expressions in Rust:

1. **Boolean Values**:

Boolean values represent the truth or falsity of a condition. In Rust, you use the `bool` type to declare boolean variables.

```rust
fn main() {
    let is_raining: bool = true;
    let is_sunny = false; // Type inference
}
```

2. **Boolean Expressions**:

Boolean expressions are used to create conditions that evaluate to either `true` or `false`.

```rust
fn main() {
    let age = 18;
    let is_adult = age >= 18; // Creates a boolean expression

    if is_adult {
        println!("You are an adult.");
    } else {
        println!("You are not an adult.");
    }
}
```

3. **Logical Operators**:

Rust provides logical operators to create more complex boolean expressions:

- `&&` (AND): Returns `true` if both operands are `true`.
- `||` (OR): Returns `true` if at least one operand is `true`.
- `!` (NOT): Negates the boolean value of its operand.

```rust
fn main() {
    let is_raining = true;
    let is_cold = true;

    if is_raining && is_cold {
        println!("It's raining and cold.");
    }

    let has_ticket = true;
    let has_permission = false;

    if has_ticket || has_permission {
        println!("You can enter.");
    }

    let is_sunny = false;

    if !is_sunny {
        println!("It's not sunny.");
    }
}
```

4. **Comparison Operators**:

Comparison operators are used to compare values and create boolean expressions:

- `==`: Equal to
- `!=`: Not equal to
- `<`: Less than
- `<=`: Less than or equal to
- `>`: Greater than
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to

```rust
fn main() {
    let num1 = 10;
    let num2 = 5;

    let is_equal = num1 == num2;
    let is_greater = num1 > num2;

    if is_equal {
        println!("Numbers are equal.");
    }

    if is_greater {
        println!("Number 1 is greater.");
    }
}
```

Boolean values and expressions are essential for controlling the flow of your program through conditions, loops, and decision-making processes. They allow you to create dynamic and responsive programs that adapt to different scenarios.
