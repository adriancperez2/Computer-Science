In Rust, variable scope defines the portion of code where a variable is accessible and valid. Variables have a limited scope in which they can be used, and Rust's ownership system helps ensure that variables are used correctly and do not cause issues like dangling references or memory leaks.

Here are some key points about variable scope in Rust:

1. **Block Scope**: The most common form of scope in Rust is the block scope. A block is a sequence of statements enclosed in curly braces `{}`. Variables declared within a block are only accessible within that block.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5; // Variable `x` is valid from here onwards

    {
        let y = 10; // Variable `y` is valid only within this block
        println!("y: {}", y);
    } // Variable `y` goes out of scope here

    println!("x: {}", x);
} // Variable `x` goes out of scope here
```

2. **Shadowing**: Shadowing allows you to declare a new variable with the same name as an existing variable. The new variable effectively "shadows" the previous one within its scope. This is useful for reusing variable names while changing their type or value.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    {
        let x = "hello"; // This `x` shadows the outer `x`
        println!("Inner x: {}", x);
    }

    println!("Outer x: {}", x); // This refers to the outer `x`
}
```

3. **Function Parameters and Scopes**: Function parameters have a scope that extends throughout the function body. If a function parameter shadows an outer variable, the shadowed variable is temporarily inaccessible within the function.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    fn demo(x: i32) {
        // The `x` parameter shadows the outer `x`
        println!("Function x: {}", x);
    }

    demo(10); // Calls the function with `x = 10`

    println!("Outer x: {}", x);
}
```

4. **Ownership and Borrowing**: Rust's ownership system ensures that variables are only accessed in safe and valid ways. Variables can be owned or borrowed, and their scope affects the validity of those ownership relationships.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello"); // `s` owns a String

    {
        let borrowed = &s; // `borrowed` borrows `s`
        println!("Borrowed: {}", borrowed);
    }

    // `borrowed` is no longer in scope, so we can mutate `s`
    let mut s = s;
    s.push_str(", world!");
    println!("Owned: {}", s);
}
```

In summary, variable scope in Rust helps control the visibility and lifetime of variables, ensuring that they are used safely and avoiding issues like data races, dangling references, and memory leaks. The ownership and borrowing concepts work in conjunction with variable scope to provide a powerful and safe system for managing data.
