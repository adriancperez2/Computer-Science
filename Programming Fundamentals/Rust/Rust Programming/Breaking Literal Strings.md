In Rust, if you have a long string that you want to break into multiple lines for better readability, you can use the newline escape sequence `\n` within the string. This escape sequence represents a line break.

Here's an example of breaking a literal string into multiple lines:

```rust
fn main() {
    let long_string = "This is a long string that\nspans multiple lines.\nEach line is separated by \\n.";

    println!("{}", long_string);
}
```

In this example, the `\n` escape sequence is used to indicate line breaks within the `long_string` variable. When you print the string, it will be displayed across multiple lines.

You can also use raw string literals (`r#`) to include line breaks without needing to escape the backslashes:

```rust
fn main() {
    let long_string = r#"This is a long string that
spans multiple lines.
Each line is separated by a line break."#;

    println!("{}", long_string);
}
```

Both of these examples achieve the same result of breaking the string into multiple lines for improved readability. Choose the approach that best fits your needs and the desired formatting for your code.
