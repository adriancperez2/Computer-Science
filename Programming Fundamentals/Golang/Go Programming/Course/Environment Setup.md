Setting up the Go programming environment is straightforward. Below are the steps to get Go up and running on your machine, including installation, setting up the Go workspace, and verifying that everything works correctly.

### 1. Install Go

#### On Windows:
1. **Download Go**: 
   - Go to the [Go downloads page](https://go.dev/dl/) and download the latest stable release for Windows.
   
2. **Run the Installer**:
   - After downloading, run the installer `.msi` file and follow the instructions in the installation wizard. The default installation path is `C:\Go`.

3. **Set up the Go Path (Optional)**:
   - By default, Go sets up the necessary environment variables during installation. However, if you need to manually set them:
     - **GOROOT**: This is where Go is installed. It should be automatically set to `C:\Go` (unless you've changed it).
     - **GOPATH**: This is the location of your workspace. It defaults to `C:\Users\<YourName>\go`.
     - **PATH**: Add `C:\Go\bin` to your `PATH` variable so you can run Go commands from anywhere in the terminal.

#### On macOS:
1. **Install Homebrew** (if you don’t have it already):
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
     ```

2. **Install Go using Homebrew**:
   - Run the following command to install Go:
     ```bash
     brew install go
     ```

3. **Verify the Installation**:
   - Homebrew automatically sets the `GOPATH` and `GOROOT` environment variables. You can check them by running:
     ```bash
     go env
     ```

#### On Linux:
1. **Download Go**:
   - Visit the [Go downloads page](https://go.dev/dl/) and download the appropriate `.tar.gz` file for your architecture (e.g., `go1.21.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz` for 64-bit Linux).

2. **Install Go**:
   - Extract the downloaded archive:
     ```bash
     sudo tar -C /usr/local -xvzf go1.21.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
     ```

3. **Set up Environment Variables**:
   - Add the following to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` (depending on your shell):
     ```bash
     export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
     export GOPATH=$HOME/go
     export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin
     ```

4. **Apply the Changes**:
   - Reload the shell configuration:
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc  # Or source ~/.zshrc
     ```

### 2. Verify Installation
After installing Go, you can verify the installation by checking the Go version:

```bash
go version
```
This should return the installed version of Go. If it doesn’t work, double-check that the Go binary is in your `PATH`.

### 3. Create a Go Workspace
Go uses a workspace for your Go projects, which is typically set up in a directory like `$HOME/go` (on most systems). This workspace has a standard structure:

```
$GOPATH/
  ├── bin/         (where executables are stored)
  ├── pkg/         (where compiled packages are stored)
  └── src/         (where Go source code lives)
```

The `src/` directory is where your Go code will reside. For example:

```
$GOPATH/
  └── src/
      └── example.com/
          └── myproject/
              └── main.go
```

You can create your first project like this:
```bash
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/example.com/myproject
cd $GOPATH/src/example.com/myproject
touch main.go
```

### 4. Write Your First Go Program
Create a simple Go program in the `main.go` file:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
}
```

### 5. Run Your Go Program
Navigate to the directory where your `main.go` is located and run:

```bash
go run main.go
```

This should print:

```
Hello, Go!
```

### 6. Install Go Modules (Optional but Recommended)
With Go 1.11 and later, Go introduced **Go Modules** to handle dependencies, which is now the preferred way to manage packages instead of using `GOPATH`.

1. **Create a Go Module**:
   - In your project directory, initialize a Go module:
     ```bash
     go mod init example.com/myproject
     ```

2. **Run Your Program with Modules**:
   - You can now run your Go program with modules (without needing to be inside the `GOPATH` folder):
     ```bash
     go run main.go
     ```

Go modules simplify dependency management by allowing projects to be outside of the `GOPATH` directory.

### 7. Set Up an IDE or Editor
For a smooth Go development experience, it's recommended to use an IDE or editor with Go support, such as:

- **Visual Studio Code**: Install the "Go" extension for syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and debugging support.
- **GoLand**: A JetBrains IDE specifically for Go development.
- **Vim/Neovim**: With plugins like `vim-go` or `coc-go`.

### Summary of Steps:
1. Download and install Go.
2. Set up environment variables (`GOPATH` and `GOROOT`).
3. Verify the installation with `go version`.
4. Create a Go workspace and project.
5. Write and run a simple Go program.
6. Optionally, use Go Modules for managing dependencies.
7. Use an IDE or editor with Go support for enhanced development.
