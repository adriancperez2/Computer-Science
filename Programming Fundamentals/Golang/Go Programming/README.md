> The Go programming language (commonly known as Golang) is a statically typed, compiled language developed by Google. It was designed by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson and released in 2009. Go is recognized for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong support for concurrency, making it ideal for building scalable systems, web servers, and cloud applications.
