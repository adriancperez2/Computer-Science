### PHP - Constant Arrays

In PHP, **constant arrays** are arrays that cannot be changed once they are defined. PHP allows you to define constants using the `define()` function, but regular arrays cannot be used directly as constants in the same way as scalar values (like integers or strings). However, you can use the `define()` function to create an array constant by specifying the array as a value.

There are some limitations and specific rules around constant arrays in PHP:

---

### 1. **Defining Constant Arrays**

You can define a constant array using the `define()` function in PHP. However, unlike variables, arrays defined as constants cannot be modified once they are set. The array will remain the same throughout the script.

#### Syntax:

```php
define('CONSTANT_NAME', array('value1', 'value2', 'value3'));
```

#### Example:

```php
define('FRUITS', ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']);
print_r(FRUITS);
```

**Output:**
```
Array
(
    [0] => apple
    [1] => banana
    [2] => cherry
)
```

In this example, the array `FRUITS` is a constant, and its values cannot be changed during script execution.

### 2. **Accessing Constant Arrays**

Once defined, you can access a constant array in the same way as any other array. You can access specific elements of the constant array by referring to its index:

```php
echo FRUITS[0];  // Output: apple
```

---

### 3. **Limitations of Constant Arrays**

- **Immutability**: Constant arrays cannot be modified. Once they are defined, they are fixed and cannot be changed during the execution of the script.
  
  ```php
  // This will result in a fatal error
  FRUITS[0] = 'grape';  // Cannot modify a constant array
  ```

- **No Support for Objects**: While you can use basic types like strings and integers in constant arrays, you cannot use objects in them. PHP constants are only meant to hold scalar values (string, integer, float, boolean, or array).

- **Global Scope**: Like regular constants, constant arrays are global in scope. Once they are defined, they are accessible throughout the script.

---

### 4. **Using `const` for Arrays (PHP 5.6 and above)**

Starting from PHP 5.6, PHP introduced the ability to define constant arrays using the `const` keyword, which was previously only used for scalar values. This allows the definition of constant arrays in a more readable way compared to `define()`.

#### Syntax:

```php
const CONSTANT_NAME = [value1, value2, value3];
```

#### Example:

```php
const COLORS = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
echo COLORS[1];  // Output: green
```

---

### 5. **Difference Between `define()` and `const` for Arrays**

- **`define()`**: Can be used to define constants at runtime (e.g., inside functions, classes), but does not support array constants in some older versions of PHP.
  
- **`const`**: Requires the constant to be defined at the top level (outside functions and classes). It is slightly more efficient than `define()` because constants declared using `const` are parsed at compile time.

---

### Conclusion

In PHP, constant arrays are arrays that cannot be modified after they are defined. You can define them using `define()` or, in newer versions of PHP (5.6 and above), using the `const` keyword. Constant arrays provide an easy way to define fixed sets of data that should not change throughout the script's execution, making your code more robust and predictable.
