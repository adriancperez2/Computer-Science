PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used, open-source scripting language primarily designed for web development. It is especially suited for creating dynamic web pages and applications. PHP is embedded in HTML and can interact with databases, handle form submissions, and perform many other server-side functions.

Key features of PHP:
- **Server-Side Scripting**: PHP runs on the server, generating HTML that is sent to the client's browser.
- **Database Integration**: PHP can work with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite, making it a popular choice for dynamic web applications.
- **Cross-Platform**: PHP works on various platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Embedded into HTML**: PHP can be written directly into HTML code, making it easy to integrate with front-end technologies.
- **Open Source**: PHP is free to use and has a large community of developers contributing to its growth.

Common use cases:
- **Dynamic Websites**: PHP is commonly used to create content management systems (CMS) like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.
- **E-Commerce**: Platforms like Magento and WooCommerce are powered by PHP.
- **Web Frameworks**: Frameworks like Laravel, Symfony, and CodeIgniter provide a structured approach to building complex PHP applications.
