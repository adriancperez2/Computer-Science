In PHP, comments are used to add explanatory notes to the code, making it easier to understand for other developers (or yourself) when reviewing the code later. PHP supports both **single-line** and **multi-line** comments.

### **1. Single-Line Comments**

PHP provides two ways to create single-line comments:

#### **Using `//` (double forward slashes)**:
- Everything after `//` on the same line is considered a comment.

```php
<?php
  // This is a single-line comment
  echo "Hello, World!";  // This is also a comment at the end of a line
?>
```

#### **Using `#` (hash sign)**:
- `#` is another way to create single-line comments, which is more commonly used in shell scripting but can also be used in PHP.

```php
<?php
  # This is another single-line comment
  echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```

### **2. Multi-Line Comments**

Multi-line comments are useful when you want to add more detailed explanations or comment out larger sections of code.

#### **Using `/*` and `*/`**:
- Multi-line comments begin with `/*` and end with `*/`. Anything between these markers is treated as a comment, regardless of the number of lines.

```php
<?php
  /*
    This is a multi-line comment.
    It spans across multiple lines.
    It is useful for longer explanations or commenting out blocks of code.
  */
  echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```

- **Note**: Multi-line comments can be used for both inline and block comments.

#### Example of multi-line comments used to comment out code:
```php
<?php
  /*
    echo "This line is commented out and will not be executed.";
    echo "This line is also commented out.";
  */
  echo "This line will be executed!";
?>
```

In this example, only `echo "This line will be executed!";` will run. The lines inside the multi-line comment are ignored by PHP.

### **3. Best Practices for Using Comments in PHP**

- **Commenting for Clarity**: Comments should clarify the purpose of the code. They should explain "why" something is being done, not just "what" is being done (which should be clear from the code itself).
  
  Example:
  ```php
  // Increment the counter to track how many items are processed
  $counter++;
  ```

- **Avoid Redundant Comments**: Don't write comments for obvious code, as this can clutter the codebase. For instance, this is unnecessary:
  ```php
  // Assigning 5 to the variable $a
  $a = 5;
  ```

- **Commenting Out Code for Debugging**: Itâ€™s common to comment out sections of code temporarily for testing or debugging. Just make sure to remove such comments before the final version of your code.

- **Use Comments for TODOs or Future Improvements**:
  ```php
  // TODO: Refactor this function to optimize performance
  ```

### **Summary of PHP Comments Syntax:**

1. **Single-line comments**:
   - `// This is a single-line comment`
   - `# This is another single-line comment`

2. **Multi-line comments**:
   - `/* This is a multi-line comment */`

Using comments effectively helps improve code readability and maintainability, especially in collaborative environments or for future code updates.
