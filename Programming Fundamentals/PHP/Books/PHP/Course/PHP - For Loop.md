### PHP `for` Loop

The **`for`** loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to execute a statement or a block of statements. It's commonly used for counting and iterating through a range of values or when the number of iterations is known.

The **`for`** loop is structured with three key components: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

### Syntax of `for` Loop

```php
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
    // Code to be executed
}
```

- **Initialization**: This part is executed once, at the beginning of the loop. It’s generally used to initialize the loop counter.
- **Condition**: This expression is evaluated before each iteration. If the condition is true, the loop continues; if false, the loop stops.
- **Increment/Decrement**: This part is executed after each iteration. It’s commonly used to update the loop variable (usually incrementing or decrementing).

### Example 1: Basic `for` Loop

In this example, we print the numbers from 1 to 5.

```php
<?php
for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {
    echo "Iteration: $i<br>";
}
?>
```

- **Explanation**:
  - **Initialization**: `$i = 1` initializes the counter variable.
  - **Condition**: `$i <= 5` checks if `$i` is less than or equal to 5.
  - **Increment**: `$i++` increments `$i` by 1 after each iteration.
  
- **Output**:
  ```
  Iteration: 1
  Iteration: 2
  Iteration: 3
  Iteration: 4
  Iteration: 5
  ```

### Example 2: Decrementing in `for` Loop

In this example, we count backward from 5 to 1.

```php
<?php
for ($i = 5; $i >= 1; $i--) {
    echo "Iteration: $i<br>";
}
?>
```

- **Explanation**:
  - **Initialization**: `$i = 5` initializes the counter to 5.
  - **Condition**: `$i >= 1` checks if `$i` is greater than or equal to 1.
  - **Decrement**: `$i--` decrements `$i` by 1 after each iteration.

- **Output**:
  ```
  Iteration: 5
  Iteration: 4
  Iteration: 3
  Iteration: 2
  Iteration: 1
  ```

### Example 3: Looping Through an Array Using `for` Loop

You can use a `for` loop to iterate through an indexed array.

```php
<?php
$fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];

for ($i = 0; $i < count($fruits); $i++) {
    echo "Fruit: " . $fruits[$i] . "<br>";
}
?>
```

- **Explanation**:
  - **Initialization**: `$i = 0` starts at the first index of the array.
  - **Condition**: `$i < count($fruits)` checks if `$i` is within the bounds of the array (i.e., less than the length of the array).
  - **Increment**: `$i++` increments the index to move to the next element.

- **Output**:
  ```
  Fruit: Apple
  Fruit: Banana
  Fruit: Cherry
  ```

### Example 4: Using Multiple Variables in a `for` Loop

You can use multiple variables inside the loop for more complex conditions.

```php
<?php
for ($i = 1, $j = 10; $i <= 5; $i++, $j--) {
    echo "i = $i, j = $j<br>";
}
?>
```

- **Explanation**:
  - **Initialization**: `$i = 1` and `$j = 10` initialize two variables.
  - **Condition**: `$i <= 5` checks if `$i` is less than or equal to 5.
  - **Increment/Decrement**: `$i++` increments `$i`, and `$j--` decrements `$j` after each iteration.

- **Output**:
  ```
  i = 1, j = 10
  i = 2, j = 9
  i = 3, j = 8
  i = 4, j = 7
  i = 5, j = 6
  ```

### Example 5: `for` Loop with `break` Statement

The `break` statement can be used to exit the loop prematurely when a certain condition is met.

```php
<?php
for ($i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++) {
    if ($i == 6) {
        break; // Exit the loop when $i is 6
    }
    echo "Iteration: $i<br>";
}
?>
```

- **Explanation**: The loop will break when `$i` equals 6, and it will not continue to the subsequent iterations.
  
- **Output**:
  ```
  Iteration: 1
  Iteration: 2
  Iteration: 3
  Iteration: 4
  Iteration: 5
  ```

---

### Example 6: `for` Loop with `continue` Statement

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.

```php
<?php
for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {
    if ($i == 3) {
        continue; // Skip the iteration when $i is 3
    }
    echo "Iteration: $i<br>";
}
?>
```

- **Explanation**: The loop skips printing the iteration when `$i` equals 3 and continues with the next iteration.

- **Output**:
  ```
  Iteration: 1
  Iteration: 2
  Iteration: 4
  Iteration: 5
  ```

### Summary of `for` Loop

- The **`for`** loop is useful when you know in advance how many times the loop should run.
- It provides complete control over initialization, condition checking, and incrementing or decrementing.
- It's ideal for tasks like counting, iterating over fixed ranges, or looping through arrays when the number of elements is known.
  
| **Part**        | **Purpose**                                |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Initialization** | Sets the initial condition (usually setting the counter). |
| **Condition**    | Determines if the loop should continue running. |
| **Increment/Decrement** | Updates the loop counter after each iteration. |

### Conclusion

The `for` loop is a powerful tool in PHP for scenarios where you know exactly how many iterations are needed or where you need fine control over loop variables. You can combine it with `break` and `continue` to further customize loop behavior based on specific conditions.
