### PHP Decision Making

In PHP, decision-making is a fundamental concept used to control the flow of the program based on conditions. It allows your program to make choices depending on whether a specific condition is true or false.

The following decision-making constructs are available in PHP:

1. **if Statement**
2. **if-else Statement**
3. **else if Statement**
4. **switch Statement**
5. **ternary Operator (`?:`)**

These structures help in executing specific code blocks depending on conditions.

### 1. **if Statement**

The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code only if the specified condition is true.

#### Syntax:

```php
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

#### Example:

```php
<?php
$age = 18;

if ($age >= 18) {
    echo "You are an adult.";
}
?>
```

- **Explanation**: Since `$age` is `18`, which is greater than or equal to `18`, the condition is true, so "You are an adult." will be printed.

---

### 2. **if-else Statement**

The `if-else` statement allows you to execute one block of code if the condition is true, and a different block of code if the condition is false.

#### Syntax:

```php
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

#### Example:

```php
<?php
$age = 16;

if ($age >= 18) {
    echo "You are an adult.";
} else {
    echo "You are a minor.";
}
?>
```

- **Explanation**: Since `$age` is `16`, which is less than `18`, the condition is false, so "You are a minor." will be printed.

---

### 3. **else if Statement**

The `else if` statement allows you to check multiple conditions. If the `if` condition is false, it will check the `else if` condition, and if that is false, it will proceed to the `else` block (if provided).

#### Syntax:

```php
if (condition1) {
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
} elseif (condition2) {
    // Code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if all conditions are false
}
```

#### Example:

```php
<?php
$age = 25;

if ($age >= 18 && $age <= 30) {
    echo "You are a young adult.";
} elseif ($age > 30 && $age <= 50) {
    echo "You are middle-aged.";
} else {
    echo "You are either too young or too old.";
}
?>
```

- **Explanation**: Since `$age` is `25`, which falls between `18` and `30`, the condition for young adult is true, so "You are a young adult." will be printed.

### 4. **switch Statement**

The `switch` statement is used to check a variable against multiple possible values. It is an alternative to using multiple `if-else` statements when you need to compare one variable against several different values.

#### Syntax:

```php
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // Code to be executed if the expression equals value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // Code to be executed if the expression equals value2
        break;
    default:
        // Code to be executed if the expression doesn't match any case
}
```

#### Example:

```php
<?php
$day = 3;

switch ($day) {
    case 1:
        echo "Monday";
        break;
    case 2:
        echo "Tuesday";
        break;
    case 3:
        echo "Wednesday";
        break;
    case 4:
        echo "Thursday";
        break;
    default:
        echo "Invalid day";
}
?>
```

- **Explanation**: The `$day` is `3`, so the code within the `case 3:` block will be executed, and "Wednesday" will be printed.

#### Example with `break`:

```php
<?php
$color = "blue";

switch ($color) {
    case "red":
        echo "Red is selected.";
        break;
    case "blue":
        echo "Blue is selected.";
        break;
    case "green":
        echo "Green is selected.";
        break;
    default:
        echo "Unknown color.";
}
?>
```

- **Explanation**: Since `$color` is `"blue"`, the output will be "Blue is selected."

---

### 5. **ternary Operator (`?:`)**

The **ternary operator** is a shorthand for a simple `if-else` statement. It is a one-line way of checking a condition.

#### Syntax:

```php
(condition) ? value_if_true : value_if_false;
```

#### Example:

```php
<?php
$age = 20;

echo ($age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";  // Outputs: Adult
?>
```

- **Explanation**: Since `$age` is `20`, which is greater than or equal to `18`, the result is `"Adult"`.

### Summary of Decision-Making Statements:

| Statement       | Description                                        | Example                                               |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **if**          | Executes code if the condition is true.            | `if ($age >= 18)`                                      |
| **if-else**     | Executes one block if true, another if false.      | `if ($age >= 18) { ... } else { ... }`                 |
| **else if**     | Checks multiple conditions sequentially.           | `if ($age >= 18) { ... } elseif ($age < 18) { ... }`  |
| **switch**      | Compares a value against several possible cases.    | `switch ($day) { case 1: echo "Monday"; break; }`      |
| **ternary**     | Shortened `if-else` statement for simple conditions. | `$result = ($age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";`          |

---

### Summary

- **`if`** statements are used for simple conditions.
- **`if-else`** and **`else if`** provide more flexibility by checking multiple conditions.
- **`switch`** is best for checking a single variable against multiple potential values.
- **The ternary operator (`?:`)** is a compact version of `if-else` for simple conditions.

These decision-making tools allow you to control the flow of your PHP programs based on various conditions.
