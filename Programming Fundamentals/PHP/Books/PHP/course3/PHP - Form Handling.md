### PHP – Form Handling

Form handling in PHP is a common task that involves receiving data from HTML forms and processing it on the server side. PHP provides several ways to handle form submissions, including the use of the `$_GET` and `$_POST` superglobals. Below, we will explore the different aspects of form handling in PHP, such as form creation, data retrieval, validation, and displaying the results.

### 1. **Creating a Basic HTML Form**

In PHP, an HTML form is created using the `<form>` tag. Forms can send data to PHP using the **GET** or **POST** methods.

#### Example: Basic HTML Form

```html
<form action="process.php" method="POST">
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
    <br><br>
    
    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email">
    <br><br>
    
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

- `action="process.php"`: Specifies the PHP script (`process.php`) where the form data will be sent for processing.
- `method="POST"`: Specifies that the data should be sent using the POST method.

### 2. **Retrieving Form Data in PHP**

Once the form is submitted, PHP can retrieve the form data using the `$_GET` or `$_POST` superglobals, depending on the form method.

- **`$_POST`** is used when the form method is POST.
- **`$_GET`** is used when the form method is GET.

#### Example: Retrieving Form Data (process.php)

```php
<?php
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    // Retrieve form data using $_POST
    $name = $_POST['name'];
    $email = $_POST['email'];

    echo "Name: " . $name . "<br>";
    echo "Email: " . $email;
}
?>
```

In this example:
- `$_POST['name']` retrieves the value of the `name` field.
- `$_POST['email']` retrieves the value of the `email` field.

This script will process the data and display it on the browser after the form is submitted.

---

### 3. **Form Validation**

Validating form data is crucial to ensure that it meets the required criteria before it is processed or stored. Common validations include checking if fields are empty, if an email is valid, or if a number falls within a specific range.

#### Example: Simple Form Validation

```php
<?php
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    $name = $_POST['name'];
    $email = $_POST['email'];

    // Check if fields are empty
    if (empty($name)) {
        echo "Name is required.<br>";
    } else {
        echo "Name: " . $name . "<br>";
    }

    if (empty($email)) {
        echo "Email is required.<br>";
    } elseif (!filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
        echo "Invalid email format.<br>";
    } else {
        echo "Email: " . $email;
    }
}
?>
```

In this example:
- **Empty Check**: We check if the `name` and `email` fields are empty using `empty()`.
- **Email Validation**: We use `filter_var()` with the `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL` filter to validate the email format.

### 4. **Displaying Submitted Form Data**

After a form is submitted and the data is validated, PHP can either display the data directly on the page or redirect to another page.

#### Example: Displaying Submitted Data

```php
<?php
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    $name = htmlspecialchars($_POST['name']);
    $email = htmlspecialchars($_POST['email']);

    echo "<h3>Form Submission Details:</h3>";
    echo "Name: " . $name . "<br>";
    echo "Email: " . $email;
}
?>
```

- **`htmlspecialchars()`** is used to escape any special HTML characters to prevent XSS (Cross-site scripting) attacks.

---

### 5. **Redirecting After Form Submission**

It’s often good practice to redirect the user to a different page after processing the form to avoid re-submitting the form when the page is refreshed (this is known as the **POST/Redirect/GET pattern**).

#### Example: Redirecting After Submission

```php
<?php
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    // Process form data here (e.g., save to database)

    // Redirect to another page
    header("Location: thank_you.php");
    exit();
}
?>
```

- **`header()`**: Sends a raw HTTP header to the browser to perform a redirect. In this case, it redirects to `thank_you.php`.
- **`exit()`**: Ensures that no further code is executed after the redirect.

---

### 6. **Handling File Uploads**

PHP provides a simple way to handle file uploads through forms. To handle file uploads, the form must use the `enctype="multipart/form-data"` attribute, and PHP provides the `$_FILES` superglobal to interact with the uploaded file.

#### Example: File Upload Form

```html
<form action="upload.php" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <label for="file">Select file:</label>
    <input type="file" name="fileToUpload" id="file">
    <input type="submit" value="Upload">
</form>
```

#### PHP: Handling the File Upload (upload.php)

```php
<?php
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    $target_dir = "uploads/";
    $target_file = $target_dir . basename($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["name"]);

    // Check if file already exists
    if (file_exists($target_file)) {
        echo "Sorry, file already exists.";
    } else {
        if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["tmp_name"], $target_file)) {
            echo "The file " . basename($_FILES["fileToUpload"]["name"]) . " has been uploaded.";
        } else {
            echo "Sorry, there was an error uploading your file.";
        }
    }
}
?>
```

In this example:
- **`$_FILES["fileToUpload"]`** contains the uploaded file information.
- **`move_uploaded_file()`** is used to move the file from its temporary location to the target directory.

### 7. **Security Considerations**

When handling forms in PHP, security is critical. Some best practices include:

- **Input Sanitization**: Always sanitize and validate form inputs to prevent injection attacks.
  - Use `htmlspecialchars()` to prevent XSS attacks.
  - Use `filter_var()` for email and URL validation.
  
- **CSRF Protection**: Protect forms against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by using **CSRF tokens**.
  
- **File Upload Security**: Always validate uploaded files to prevent malicious files from being uploaded and executed on the server. Limit file types and file sizes.

### Conclusion

PHP form handling is a crucial part of web development, allowing users to send and retrieve data from a website. By creating forms, processing the submitted data, and validating it on the server side, PHP provides a powerful way to build interactive web applications. With additional features like file uploads and redirects, PHP enables dynamic, secure, and user-friendly forms.
