### Python - Graph Data

**Graph data** refers to data that is represented in the form of graphs, where entities (also known as nodes or vertices) are connected by edges (also called links or arcs). Graphs are used to model various relationships, such as social networks, transportation systems, web pages, and more.

In Python, graph data can be represented and analyzed using libraries such as **NetworkX**, **Graph-tool**, and **PyGraphviz**. These libraries provide tools for creating, manipulating, and analyzing the structure of graphs.

### 1. **Graph Data Structures**

A **graph** is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges (links). There are different types of graphs:
- **Directed Graph (DiGraph)**: Edges have a direction (from one node to another).
- **Undirected Graph**: Edges do not have direction.
- **Weighted Graph**: Edges have weights or costs associated with them.
- **Unweighted Graph**: Edges do not have any weights.

---

### 2. **NetworkX Library**

**NetworkX** is one of the most popular libraries for working with graphs in Python. It allows you to create, manipulate, and analyze graph structures. NetworkX supports various types of graphs (directed, undirected, weighted, etc.) and offers a range of algorithms for graph analysis.

#### a. **Installing NetworkX**

```bash
pip install networkx
```

#### b. **Creating Graphs with NetworkX**

You can create a graph using NetworkX with the `Graph()` (for undirected graphs) or `DiGraph()` (for directed graphs) class.

##### Example: Creating a Simple Graph

```python
import networkx as nx

# Create an undirected graph
G = nx.Graph()

# Add nodes
G.add_node(1)
G.add_node(2)

# Add an edge between nodes
G.add_edge(1, 2)

# Display nodes and edges
print("Nodes:", G.nodes())
print("Edges:", G.edges())
```

Output:
```
Nodes: [1, 2]
Edges: [(1, 2)]
```

You can also add multiple nodes and edges at once using `add_nodes_from()` and `add_edges_from()`.

##### Example: Adding Multiple Nodes and Edges

```python
# Add multiple nodes
G.add_nodes_from([3, 4])

# Add multiple edges
G.add_edges_from([(2, 3), (3, 4)])

print("Nodes:", G.nodes())
print("Edges:", G.edges())
```

Output:
```
Nodes: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Edges: [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]
```

### 3. **Visualizing Graphs with NetworkX**

NetworkX integrates well with **Matplotlib** for graph visualization.

##### Example: Visualizing a Graph

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a simple graph
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)])

# Draw the graph
nx.draw(G, with_labels=True, node_color='lightblue', node_size=2000, font_size=16)
plt.show()
```

This will display the graph with labeled nodes and edges in a simple layout.

---

### 4. **Graph Algorithms in NetworkX**

NetworkX provides a variety of algorithms for analyzing graphs, such as:
- **Shortest path**: Find the shortest path between two nodes.
- **Centrality**: Measure the importance of nodes in a graph.
- **Connectivity**: Check if the graph is connected (i.e., thereâ€™s a path between any two nodes).
- **Community detection**: Find groups of nodes that are densely connected.

#### a. **Finding the Shortest Path**

```python
# Find the shortest path between two nodes
shortest_path = nx.shortest_path(G, source=1, target=4)
print("Shortest path from 1 to 4:", shortest_path)
```

#### b. **Node Degree**

The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.

```python
# Get the degree of each node
degree = G.degree()
print("Node degrees:", degree)
```

Output:
```
Node degrees: [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 1)]
```

#### c. **Graph Connectivity**

You can check if the graph is connected or not.

```python
# Check if the graph is connected
is_connected = nx.is_connected(G)
print("Is the graph connected?", is_connected)
```

---

### 5. **Directed Graphs with NetworkX**

In a directed graph (DiGraph), edges have a direction, which is represented by arrows.

#### a. **Creating a Directed Graph**

```python
# Create a directed graph
DG = nx.DiGraph()

# Add nodes and edges
DG.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)])

# Display nodes and edges
print("Nodes:", DG.nodes())
print("Edges:", DG.edges())
```

Output:
```
Nodes: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Edges: [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]
```

#### b. **Visualizing Directed Graphs**

```python
# Visualize directed graph
nx.draw(DG, with_labels=True, node_color='lightgreen', node_size=2000, font_size=16, arrows=True)
plt.show()
```

This will display a directed graph with arrows indicating the direction of edges.

---

### 6. **Weighted Graphs**

You can add weights to the edges of a graph, which can represent distances, costs, or other metrics.

#### a. **Creating a Weighted Graph**

```python
# Create a weighted graph
WG = nx.Graph()

# Add edges with weights
WG.add_edge(1, 2, weight=4)
WG.add_edge(2, 3, weight=5)
WG.add_edge(3, 4, weight=6)

# Display the edges with weights
print("Edges with weights:", WG.edges(data=True))
```

Output:
```
Edges with weights: [(1, 2, {'weight': 4}), (2, 3, {'weight': 5}), (3, 4, {'weight': 6})]
```

#### b. **Finding the Shortest Path in a Weighted Graph**

You can find the shortest path in a weighted graph using the `dijkstra_path()` function.

```python
# Find the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm
shortest_path = nx.dijkstra_path(WG, source=1, target=4, weight='weight')
print("Shortest path from 1 to 4:", shortest_path)
```

### 7. **Graph Properties**

You can explore various properties of graphs, such as:
- **Degree Centrality**: A measure of node importance based on degree.
- **Clustering Coefficient**: Measures how connected the neighbors of a node are to each other.
- **PageRank**: An algorithm used by Google to rank web pages.

#### a. **Degree Centrality**

```python
# Compute degree centrality
centrality = nx.degree_centrality(G)
print("Degree centrality:", centrality)
```

#### b. **Clustering Coefficient**

```python
# Compute clustering coefficient for each node
clustering = nx.clustering(G)
print("Clustering coefficient:", clustering)
```

#### c. **PageRank**

```python
# Compute PageRank
pagerank = nx.pagerank(G)
print("PageRank:", pagerank)
```

---

### 8. **Graph Data Formats**

Graphs can be saved and loaded in various formats:
- **Adjacency List**
- **Edge List**
- **GraphML**
- **GML**
- **Pickle**

#### a. **Saving and Loading Graphs**

```python
# Save graph to a file in GraphML format
nx.write_graphml(G, "graph.graphml")

# Load graph from a GraphML file
G_loaded = nx.read_graphml("graph.graphml")
```

---

### 9. **Advanced Graph Libraries**

While **NetworkX** is the most commonly used library, there are other libraries that provide advanced graph capabilities:

- **Graph-tool**: A Python library for manipulation and statistical analysis of graphs. It is faster than NetworkX but has a steeper learning curve.
- **PyGraphviz**: A Python interface to the **Graphviz** library, useful for creating and rendering graphs.
