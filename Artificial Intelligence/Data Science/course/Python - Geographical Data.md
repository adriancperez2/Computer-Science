### Python - Geographical Data

**Geographical data** refers to information that is related to specific locations or regions on the Earth's surface. In Python, there are a variety of tools and libraries to work with geographical data, including visualizing maps, analyzing spatial data, and working with geospatial formats (such as **GeoJSON**, **Shapefiles**, etc.).

Key Python libraries for working with geographical data include:
- **Geopandas**: For working with spatial data (similar to pandas but for geospatial data).
- **Folium**: For creating interactive maps.
- **Matplotlib and Basemap**: For creating static geographical plots.
- **Shapely**: For geometric operations (points, lines, polygons).
- **Cartopy**: For map projections and geospatial data visualization.
- **Pyproj**: For working with coordinate systems and projections.
- **Plotly**: For interactive geographical visualizations.

### 1. **Geospatial Data with Geopandas**

**Geopandas** is an extension of **pandas** that makes working with geospatial data easier. It allows you to read and write various spatial file formats (e.g., Shapefiles, GeoJSON), perform spatial operations, and visualize data.

#### a. **Installing Geopandas**

```bash
pip install geopandas
```

#### b. **Reading Geospatial Data**

You can read geospatial data into a GeoDataFrame (a pandas-like object for geospatial data).

##### Example: Reading a Shapefile or GeoJSON

```python
import geopandas as gpd

# Read a shapefile or GeoJSON file
gdf = gpd.read_file('path_to_shapefile.shp')  # or use a GeoJSON file
print(gdf.head())
```

- **GeoDataFrame**: A GeoDataFrame is similar to a pandas DataFrame but can handle geometries like points, lines, and polygons.
- **Shapefile**: A common format for geospatial data.
- **GeoJSON**: Another common format for encoding geographic data.

#### c. **Basic Geospatial Operations**

Once you load geospatial data into a GeoDataFrame, you can perform various operations such as filtering data based on geometry, spatial joins, and more.

##### Example: Filtering Based on Geometry (e.g., Area)

```python
# Filter rows where geometry is within a certain area
gdf = gdf[gdf.geometry.area > 1000]
```

#### d. **Visualizing Geospatial Data**

GeoDataFrames can be easily visualized using **matplotlib** or **folium** for interactive maps.

##### Example: Plotting Geospatial Data with Matplotlib

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot the geometries on a map
gdf.plot()
plt.show()
```

This will generate a simple static map with the geometries from the GeoDataFrame.

### 2. **Interactive Maps with Folium**

**Folium** is a Python library that allows you to create interactive maps. It uses **Leaflet.js** under the hood to produce interactive visualizations.

#### a. **Installing Folium**

```bash
pip install folium
```

#### b. **Creating a Simple Map**

Folium allows you to create maps centered on a specific latitude and longitude.

##### Example: Basic Folium Map

```python
import folium

# Create a map centered at a specific location
m = folium.Map(location=[51.5074, -0.1278], zoom_start=10)  # London

# Display the map
m.save("map.html")  # Save the map to an HTML file
```

This will create an interactive map centered on London, which you can open in your web browser.

#### c. **Adding Markers and Popups**

You can add **markers** to the map to indicate specific locations.

##### Example: Adding a Marker

```python
# Add a marker with a popup
folium.Marker([51.5074, -0.1278], popup="London").add_to(m)

# Save the map
m.save("map_with_marker.html")
```

This adds a marker at the coordinates for London with a popup displaying the text "London."

### 3. **Geospatial Data Operations with Shapely**

**Shapely** is a Python library for geometric operations. It allows for manipulation and analysis of planar geometric objects like points, lines, and polygons.

#### a. **Installing Shapely**

```bash
pip install shapely
```

#### b. **Basic Operations with Shapely**

You can create and manipulate geometric shapes (e.g., points, polygons) using Shapely.

##### Example: Creating and Manipulating Points and Polygons

```python
from shapely.geometry import Point, Polygon

# Create a point
point = Point(1, 1)

# Create a polygon
polygon = Polygon([(0, 0), (0, 2), (2, 2), (2, 0)])

# Check if the point is inside the polygon
print(polygon.contains(point))  # Output: True or False
```

- **Point**: Represents a point in 2D space.
- **Polygon**: Represents a polygon defined by a list of (x, y) coordinates.
- **contains()**: Checks if the polygon contains a point.

### 4. **Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding**

Geocoding is the process of converting addresses into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), while reverse geocoding is the opposite: converting geographic coordinates into an address.

**Geopy** is a popular Python library for geocoding.

#### a. **Installing Geopy**

```bash
pip install geopy
```

#### b. **Geocoding an Address**

```python
from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim

# Initialize geocoder
geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="geoapiExercises")

# Geocode an address
location = geolocator.geocode("1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC")
print(location.address)
print(location.latitude, location.longitude)
```

This will return the address and geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude) for the given address.

#### c. **Reverse Geocoding**

```python
# Reverse geocoding a coordinate
location = geolocator.reverse((51.5074, -0.1278))
print(location.address)
```

This will return the nearest address to the given latitude and longitude.

### 5. **Mapping and Visualization with Plotly**

**Plotly** can also be used to create interactive geographical visualizations, such as choropleth maps (which display data using color gradients) and scatter plots on maps.

#### a. **Installing Plotly**

```bash
pip install plotly
```

#### b. **Creating a Choropleth Map**

A **choropleth map** is a map where areas are shaded based on the value of a variable.

##### Example: Creating a Simple Choropleth Map

```python
import plotly.express as px

# Example data: Population by country
df = px.data.gapminder()

# Create a choropleth map
fig = px.choropleth(df, locations="iso_alpha", color="pop", hover_name="country", 
                    color_continuous_scale=px.colors.sequential.Plasma)

fig.update_layout(title="Global Population Choropleth Map")
fig.show()
```

- `locations`: Defines the geographic locations.
- `color`: The variable used to color the map.

---

### 6. **Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)**

Different geospatial datasets may use different **Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)**. **Geopandas** allows you to reproject your data into different CRS using the `to_crs()` method.

##### Example: Reprojecting to a Different CRS

```python
# Convert from one CRS to another (e.g., to EPSG:4326)
gdf = gdf.to_crs(epsg=4326)
```

- **EPSG:4326** refers to the WGS 84 coordinate system (latitude/longitude).

---

### 7. **Working with Raster Data**

**Raster data** is another form of geospatial data, typically used for satellite images or elevation data. **Rasterio** is a Python library for reading and writing raster data.

#### a. **Installing Rasterio**

```bash
pip install rasterio
```

#### b. **Reading and Plotting Raster Data**

```python
import rasterio
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read raster data (e.g., GeoTIFF)
with rasterio.open('path_to_raster.tif') as dataset:
    data = dataset.read(1)  # Read the first band

# Plot the raster data
plt.imshow(data, cmap='gray')
plt.show()
```
