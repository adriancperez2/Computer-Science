### **Linear Regression in Machine Learning**

**Linear Regression** is one of the simplest and most commonly used algorithms in machine learning. It models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) by fitting a linear equation to the data.

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Hypothesis (Model)**:
   - The linear regression model assumes a linear relationship:
     $\[
     y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \dots + \beta_nx_n + \epsilon
     \]$
     Where:
     - \(y\): Dependent variable (target).
     - $\(x_i\)$: Independent variables (features).
     - $\(\beta_0\)$: Intercept (constant term).
     - $\(\beta_i\)$: Coefficients (weights for each feature).
     - $\(\epsilon\)$: Error term.

2. **Goal**:
   - Minimize the error between the predicted values (\(\hat{y}\)) and the actual values (\(y\)).
   - Typically done using **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**, which minimizes the **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)**.

3. **Types of Linear Regression**:
   - **Simple Linear Regression**: One independent variable.
   - **Multiple Linear Regression**: Two or more independent variables.

### **Loss Function**

The loss function measures the discrepancy between actual and predicted values. In linear regression, the commonly used loss function is:
$\[
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
\]$
Where:
- \(n\): Number of observations.
- $\(y_i\)$: Actual value of the \(i\)-th observation.
- $\(\hat{y}_i\)$: Predicted value of the \(i\)-th observation.

### **Steps in Linear Regression**

1. **Prepare the Data**:
   - Handle missing values, scale features if necessary, and split data into training and testing sets.

2. **Train the Model**:
   - Fit the linear equation using the training data.

3. **Evaluate the Model**:
   - Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and $\(R^2\)$ to assess performance.

4. **Make Predictions**:
   - Use the trained model to predict on unseen data.

---

### **Assumptions of Linear Regression**

1. **Linearity**:
   - The relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear.

2. **Independence**:
   - Observations are independent of each other.

3. **Homoscedasticity**:
   - Constant variance of errors $(\(\epsilon\))$ across all levels of the independent variables.

4. **Normality**:
   - The errors (\(\epsilon\)) are normally distributed.

5. **No Multicollinearity**:
   - Independent variables are not highly correlated with each other.

---

### **Evaluation Metrics for Linear Regression**

1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**:
   $\[
   MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n |y_i - \hat{y}_i|
   \]$

2. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:
   $\[
   MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
   \]$

3. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**:
   $\[
   RMSE = \sqrt{MSE}
   \]$

4. **R-squared (\(R^2\))**:
   - Explains the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables:
```math
     R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{SS}_{\text{res}}}{\text{SS}_{\text{tot}}}

     Where:
     - (\text{SS}_{\text{res}} = \sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 (Residual Sum of Squares).
     - (\text{SS}_{\text{tot}} = \sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2 (Total Sum of Squares).
```

### **Python Implementation: Simple Linear Regression**

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate sample data
np.random.seed(0)
X = 2 * np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = 4 + 3 * X + np.random.normal(scale=1, size=(100, 1))

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Coefficients
print("Intercept:", model.intercept_)
print("Slope:", model.coef_)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
print(f"R-squared: {r2}")

# Plot the results
plt.scatter(X_test, y_test, color='blue', label='Actual')
plt.plot(X_test, y_pred, color='red', label='Predicted')
plt.legend()
plt.title("Simple Linear Regression")
plt.show()
```

1. **Simplicity**:
   - Easy to implement and interpret.

2. **Efficiency**:
   - Works well for small to moderately sized datasets.

3. **Foundational**:
   - Serves as a basis for more complex algorithms.

### **Limitations of Linear Regression**

1. **Linearity Assumption**:
   - Fails when the relationship is non-linear.

2. **Sensitivity to Outliers**:
   - Outliers can significantly impact the model.

3. **Multicollinearity**:
   - Highly correlated features can distort predictions.

4. **Heteroscedasticity**:
   - Non-constant variance in errors affects performance.

   - Forecasting sales or predicting consumer spending.

2. **Healthcare**:
   - Predicting disease progression or hospital readmissions.

3. **Real Estate**:
   - Estimating property prices.

4. **Marketing**:
   - Analyzing the impact of advertising expenditure on revenue.

5. **Engineering**:
