> Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on developing algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Unlike traditional programming, where explicit instructions are given to solve a problem, ML enables systems to improve their performance on tasks by learning from examples (data).
