> Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the branch of computer science that aims to create machines or software capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI systems can learn from data, adapt to new information, and make decisions, solving problems in ways that mimic human cognition or even exceed human performance in certain domains.
