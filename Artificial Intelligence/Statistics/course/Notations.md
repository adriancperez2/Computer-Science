---

### **1. General Notations**

- **$\(\mu\)$**: Population mean (average of all values in a population).
- **$\(\bar{x}\)$**: Sample mean (average of values in a sample).
- **$\(\sigma^2\)$**: Population variance (measure of the spread of a population).
- **$\(s^2\)$**: Sample variance (measure of the spread of a sample).
- **$\(\sigma\)$**: Population standard deviation (square root of the population variance).
- **\(s\)**: Sample standard deviation (square root of the sample variance).

  \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \quad \text{represents the sum of all data points.}
  \]$

### **6. Correlation and Regression**

- **\(r\)**: Pearson correlation coefficient (measure of linear correlation between two variables).
- **$\(\beta_0\)$**: Y-intercept in regression (constant term).
- **$\(\beta_1\)$**: Slope in simple linear regression (the rate of change of \(y\) with respect to \(x\)).
- **$\(\hat{y}\)$**: Predicted value of \(y\) (from regression).

- **$\(X \sim \mathcal{B}(n, p)\)$**: Binomial distribution, where \(n\) is the number of trials and \(p\) is the probability of success in a single trial.
- **$\(X \sim \mathcal{P}(\lambda)\)$**: Poisson distribution with parameter $\(\lambda\)$, often used for modeling rare events.
- **$\(X \sim \mathcal{U}(a, b)\)$**: Uniform distribution, where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lower and upper bounds of the distribution.
