The **Arithmetic Range** is a measure of statistical dispersion or spread, which represents the difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset. It gives an idea of the extent to which the data values vary, but it is sensitive to outliers and doesn't account for the distribution of all the data points.

### Formula for Range:
$\[
\text{Range} = \text{Maximum Value} - \text{Minimum Value}
\]$

Where:
- The **Maximum Value** is the largest value in the dataset.
- The **Minimum Value** is the smallest value in the dataset.

### How to Calculate the Range:
1. **Identify the Maximum and Minimum Values** in the dataset.
2. **Subtract the Minimum Value** from the Maximum Value.

### Example 1: Basic Range Calculation
Consider the dataset:
\[ 3, 8, 5, 2, 10 \]

1. **Maximum Value** = 10
2. **Minimum Value** = 2

$\[
\text{Range} = 10 - 2 = 8
\]$

So, the **range** of this dataset is **8**.

### Example 2: Dataset with Larger Spread
Consider the dataset:
\[ 100, 50, 200, 30, 150 \]

1. **Maximum Value** = 200
2. **Minimum Value** = 30

$\[
\text{Range} = 200 - 30 = 170
\]$

So, the **range** of this dataset is **170**.

### Key Features of the Range:
1. **Simplicity**: The range is one of the easiest measures of spread to calculate.
2. **Sensitivity to Outliers**: The range is highly sensitive to outliers (extreme values), meaning a single very large or very small value can significantly increase the range.
   - For example, in the dataset \[1, 2, 3, 1000\], the range is \(1000 - 1 = 999\), which doesn't represent the majority of the data well.
3. **Limited Information**: The range does not provide information about how the values are distributed between the minimum and maximum values. For instance, datasets with the same range can still have very different distributions of values.

### When to Use the Range:
- When you want a **quick sense** of the spread or variability in a dataset.
- In datasets where **outliers** are not a significant concern.
- For **small datasets** or **exploratory data analysis** where a more detailed measure of dispersion (like variance or standard deviation) is not required.

### Limitations of the Range:
- **Insensitive to Distribution**: The range only considers the two extreme values, ignoring the distribution of values in between.
- **Outliers Impact**: A single outlier can significantly skew the range, leading to a misleading sense of variability in the data.

### Comparison with Other Measures of Spread:
- **Range** vs. **Variance/Standard Deviation**: Both range and standard deviation measure spread, but the standard deviation considers all data points and is less sensitive to extreme values.
- **Range** vs. **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: The IQR measures the range of the middle 50% of the data and is less affected by outliers than the total range.
