### **Chi-Squared Table (χ² Table)**

The **Chi-Squared table** is a statistical table used to determine critical values of the **Chi-Squared distribution** for different degrees of freedom (df) and significance levels (α). It is commonly used in hypothesis testing, especially for the **Chi-Squared goodness-of-fit test** and the **Chi-Squared test for independence**.

#### **Structure of the Chi-Squared Table:**

- **Degrees of Freedom (df)**: The rows of the table represent the **degrees of freedom (df)**, which typically correspond to the number of categories minus one (for goodness-of-fit tests) or the number of rows minus one and the number of columns minus one (for tests of independence).
  
- **Significance Levels (α)**: The columns represent the **significance level (α)**, often denoted as 0.10, 0.05, or 0.01, which corresponds to the area in the right tail of the Chi-Squared distribution. This area represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (type I error).

#### **Example of Chi-Squared Table:**

Here is a simplified version of a Chi-Squared table showing the critical values for various degrees of freedom (df) and significance levels (α):

| **df \ α** | **0.10** | **0.05** | **0.01** |
|------------|----------|----------|----------|
| **1**      | 2.705    | 3.841    | 6.635    |
| **2**      | 4.605    | 5.991    | 9.210    |
| **3**      | 6.251    | 7.815    | 11.345   |
| **4**      | 7.779    | 9.488    | 13.277   |
| **5**      | 9.236    | 11.070   | 15.086   |
| **6**      | 10.645   | 12.592   | 16.812   |
| **7**      | 12.017   | 14.067   | 18.475   |
| **8**      | 13.362   | 15.507   | 20.090   |
| **9**      | 14.684   | 16.919   | 21.666   |
| **10**     | 16.045   | 18.307   | 23.209   |

#### **How to Use the Chi-Squared Table:**

1. **Determine the Degrees of Freedom (df):**
   - For a **goodness-of-fit test**, df is calculated as:
     $\[
     \text{df} = k - 1
     \]$
     where \( k \) is the number of categories.
   - For a **test of independence**, df is calculated as:
     $\[
     \text{df} = (r - 1)(c - 1)
     \]$
     where \( r \) is the number of rows and \( c \) is the number of columns in the contingency table.

2. **Choose the Significance Level (α):**
   Select the significance level you want to test, typically 0.10, 0.05, or 0.01. This will be the probability you are willing to accept for a type I error (false positive).

3. **Find the Critical Value:**
   - Look up the **degrees of freedom (df)** on the left-hand side of the table.
   - Move across to the column that corresponds to your chosen significance level (α).
   - The value in the table is the critical value for your test. 

4. **Compare the Test Statistic with the Critical Value:**
   - Calculate the **Chi-Squared statistic** for your test based on your data.
   - If the **Chi-Squared statistic** is greater than the critical value from the table, reject the null hypothesis (indicating a significant result).
   - If the **Chi-Squared statistic** is less than or equal to the critical value, do not reject the null hypothesis (indicating no significant result).

#### **Example:**

Suppose you are performing a **Chi-Squared test for independence** with a contingency table that has **4 rows** and **3 columns**, and you are testing at the **0.05 significance level**.

1. **Degrees of Freedom (df)**:
   $\[
   \text{df} = (4 - 1)(3 - 1) = 3 \times 2 = 6
   \]$

2. **Significance Level (α)**: 0.05.

3. **Find the Critical Value**:  
   From the table above, for $\( df = 6 \)$ and $\( α = 0.05 \)$, the critical value is **12.592**.

4. **Test Statistic**:  
   Suppose you calculate the Chi-Squared statistic for your data and find that it is **15.00**. Since **15.00** is greater than the critical value of **12.592**, you would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant relationship between the two categorical variables.

#### **Conclusion:**

The Chi-Squared table is a useful tool for conducting **Chi-Squared tests** by comparing the computed test statistic with the critical values for different degrees of freedom and significance levels. It helps to make decisions about rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis based on the data and the test's significance level.
