### **Statistics - Type I & Type II Errors**

In hypothesis testing, two types of errors can occur when making decisions about a population based on sample data:

1. **Type I Error** (False Positive)
2. **Type II Error** (False Negative)

Both errors are related to incorrect conclusions drawn from statistical tests, and understanding them is crucial for correctly interpreting test results.

### **Type I Error (False Positive)**

A **Type I error** occurs when a null hypothesis (H₀) is rejected when it is actually true. In other words, you incorrectly conclude that there is an effect or difference when, in fact, there is none.

#### **Example:**
- **Null hypothesis (H₀)**: A new drug has no effect on patients.
- **Alternative hypothesis (H₁)**: The new drug has an effect on patients.
- **Type I Error**: You conclude that the new drug has an effect, even though it does not (rejecting H₀ when it is true).

#### **Significance Level (α):**
- The probability of committing a Type I error is denoted by **α** (alpha), also known as the **significance level** of the test.
- **α = 0.05** means there is a 5% chance of making a Type I error (rejecting H₀ when it is actually true).
- A smaller value of α reduces the probability of making a Type I error but increases the risk of making a Type II error (as explained below).

### **Type II Error (False Negative)**

A **Type II error** occurs when the null hypothesis (H₀) is not rejected when it is actually false. In other words, you fail to detect an effect or difference that actually exists.

#### **Example:**
- **Null hypothesis (H₀)**: A new drug has no effect on patients.
- **Alternative hypothesis (H₁)**: The new drug has an effect on patients.
- **Type II Error**: You conclude that the new drug has no effect, even though it does (failing to reject H₀ when it is false).

#### **Power of the Test (1 - β):**
- The probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis is called the **power** of the test.
- **β** (beta) represents the probability of making a Type II error.
- A higher power (closer to 1) reduces the chance of a Type II error. The power of a test depends on factors like sample size, effect size, and significance level (α).

### **Relationship Between Type I and Type II Errors**

- **Trade-off**: There is a trade-off between Type I and Type II errors. If you decrease the probability of making a Type I error (by lowering α), you increase the probability of making a Type II error (increasing β), and vice versa.
- **Balancing the Errors**: In most cases, researchers aim to minimize both errors, but the acceptable levels of Type I and Type II errors depend on the context and the consequences of each error.

### **Visualizing Type I and Type II Errors**

- **Type I Error**: Rejection of a true null hypothesis (false positive). You mistakenly detect an effect that doesn’t exist.
  - **Diagram**: In a normal distribution curve, the Type I error is represented by the area under the curve that corresponds to rejecting H₀ when it is true (α level).
  
- **Type II Error**: Failure to reject a false null hypothesis (false negative). You miss detecting a true effect.
  - **Diagram**: In a normal distribution curve, the Type II error is represented by the area where the test fails to detect a true effect (1 - β level).

### **Minimizing Type I and Type II Errors**

- **Increase Sample Size**: A larger sample size reduces the probability of both Type I and Type II errors by providing more precise estimates.
  
- **Adjust Significance Level (α)**: Reducing α lowers the chance of a Type I error but may increase the risk of a Type II error. A common α value is 0.05, but it can be adjusted based on the context.
  
- **Increase Power (1 - β)**: You can increase the power of a test by increasing the sample size, improving the measurement process, or choosing a more sensitive test.

### **Conclusion**

Type I and Type II errors are fundamental concepts in hypothesis testing. **Type I error** occurs when you incorrectly reject a true null hypothesis, while **Type II error** happens when you fail to reject a false null hypothesis. Understanding the balance between these errors is crucial for making informed decisions based on statistical tests and designing experiments with appropriate sample sizes and significance levels.
