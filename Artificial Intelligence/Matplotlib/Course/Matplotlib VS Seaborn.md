**Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** are both popular Python libraries used for data visualization, but they differ in terms of their functionality, ease of use, and features.

### **Matplotlib**
- **Purpose**: Matplotlib is a low-level, flexible plotting library that allows you to create a wide variety of visualizations. It provides complete control over the appearance of plots.
- **Customization**: You can customize nearly every aspect of the plot, such as colors, line styles, gridlines, and axes. However, this flexibility can sometimes make it more complicated to create plots with attractive default styles.
- **Usage**: It requires more lines of code for creating complex plots, as you have to manually adjust plot aesthetics like ticks, labels, legends, etc.
- **Plot Types**: Matplotlib can generate a broad range of 2D and 3D plots, including basic charts (line, bar, scatter), histograms, pie charts, contour plots, etc.
- **Learning Curve**: Due to its flexibility, Matplotlib has a steeper learning curve, especially when you're aiming for complex or customized visualizations.

#### Example (Matplotlib):
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Sine Wave')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('Y')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### **Seaborn**
- **Purpose**: Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a higher-level interface for creating more aesthetically pleasing and informative statistical plots. It simplifies the process of making common plots and improves the default visual style.
- **Customization**: Seaborn comes with built-in themes and color palettes that make it easier to create attractive plots with minimal code. While it simplifies customization, it also provides several options for advanced customization if needed.
- **Usage**: Seaborn is designed to work with **Pandas DataFrames**, which makes it easier to visualize and analyze data. It handles many tasks automatically, such as setting labels and titles, and it has built-in statistical functions (like regression lines, box plots, etc.).
- **Plot Types**: Seaborn excels in statistical plots, such as pair plots, violin plots, heatmaps, and distribution plots, but it also supports basic charts like line plots, bar plots, and scatter plots.
- **Learning Curve**: Seaborn has a gentler learning curve, particularly for statistical visualizations, because it does much of the work for you, allowing you to focus on the data.

#### Example (Seaborn):
```python
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Create a simple DataFrame
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': np.linspace(0, 10, 100),
    'y': np.sin(np.linspace(0, 10, 100))
})

# Create a simple line plot with Seaborn
sns.lineplot(x='x', y='y', data=data)
plt.title('Sine Wave')
plt.show()
```

### **Key Differences**

| Feature               | **Matplotlib**                                        | **Seaborn**                                         |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Ease of Use**        | More control, but requires more code and customization. | Easier to use, especially for statistical plots.    |
| **Aesthetics**         | Default style is minimal, customization required.     | Attractive default themes and color palettes.       |
| **Plotting Style**     | Low-level, flexible plotting library.                 | High-level interface built on top of Matplotlib.    |
| **Statistical Plots**  | Limited built-in statistical plot support.            | Extensive support for statistical plots.           |
| **Integration**        | Works well with NumPy, Pandas, etc.                   | Best used with Pandas DataFrames.                   |
| **Complexity**         | More complex for creating advanced visualizations.    | Simplifies complex visualizations with less code.   |
| **Customizability**    | Highly customizable in all aspects of the plot.       | Customizable but focuses on improving default styles. |

### **When to Use Each**:
- **Use Matplotlib** if you need fine-grained control over the appearance of your plots, or if you're creating complex visualizations that require custom tweaks and adjustments.
- **Use Seaborn** if you're focused on statistical data analysis and want to quickly generate attractive, insightful plots with minimal code.

In practice, many users combine both libraries: **Seaborn** for quick, attractive statistical visualizations and **Matplotlib** for more detailed customization.
