AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique used in web development to create dynamic, interactive user interfaces. It allows web pages to update content asynchronously (in the background) without needing to reload the entire page. This results in faster, smoother, and more responsive web applications.

Key features of AJAX include:

1. **Asynchronous Requests**: AJAX enables communication with the server in the background without interrupting the user's interaction with the page. This makes it possible to fetch or send data to the server without refreshing the entire page.

2. **JavaScript**: AJAX relies on JavaScript to send requests and handle responses. It uses the `XMLHttpRequest` object (or the modern `Fetch` API) to interact with the server.

3. **Data Formats**: Although AJAX originally used XML to exchange data, modern applications often use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) due to its simplicity and compatibility with JavaScript.

4. **Server Communication**: AJAX sends and receives data from the server, allowing developers to fetch information like database queries, form submissions, or updates without needing a page reload.

AJAX is widely used in applications such as Gmail, Google Maps, and social media platforms, where real-time data updates are essential.
