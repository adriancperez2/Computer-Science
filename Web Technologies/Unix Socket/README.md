> A Unix socket (also called Unix domain socket) is a communication endpoint used for inter-process communication (IPC) on the same machine. Unlike network sockets, which use IP addresses and ports for communication between processes on different machines, Unix sockets allow communication between processes on the same machine without the overhead of networking protocols.
