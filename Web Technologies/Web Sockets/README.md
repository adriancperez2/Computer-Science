> WebSockets are a protocol for full-duplex communication channels over a single, long-lived TCP connection, commonly used in web applications. Unlike HTTP, which is a request-response protocol, WebSockets allow for persistent connections where both the server and client can send and receive messages independently, making it ideal for real-time communication.
