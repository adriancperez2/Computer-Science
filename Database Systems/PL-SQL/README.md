> PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language) is a procedural extension for SQL, developed by Oracle Corporation. It allows developers to write complex scripts and programs within the Oracle Database environment, combining SQL's data manipulation capabilities with procedural programming features like loops, conditions, and exception handling.
