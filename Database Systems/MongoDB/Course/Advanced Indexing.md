### **MongoDB - Advanced Indexing**

Indexing is one of the most important performance optimizations in MongoDB. While basic indexes such as single-field indexes are commonly used, MongoDB provides a variety of **advanced indexing techniques** to address more complex query patterns. These advanced indexing methods allow you to optimize your database queries for various use cases, such as text search, geospatial queries, and performance tuning for larger datasets.

Let's explore some of the advanced indexing strategies that MongoDB offers:

---

### **1. Compound Indexes**

A **compound index** is an index on multiple fields within a single document. Compound indexes are useful for queries that filter on multiple fields, as they allow MongoDB to quickly retrieve documents based on the combination of these fields.

#### **Example: Creating a Compound Index**

```js
db.users.createIndex({ age: 1, name: 1 });
```

In this case, the index is created on both `age` and `name`. Queries that filter on both `age` and `name` will be able to use this index effectively.

#### **When to Use Compound Indexes**:
- When your queries use multiple fields in the `find()` filter.
- To support queries that involve sorting or range queries on more than one field.
- Be mindful of the order of fields in a compound index. The leftmost prefix of the index is used for querying, so the order of fields is crucial.

#### **Example of Using a Compound Index in a Query**

```js
db.users.find({ age: 30, name: "Alice" });
```

The compound index on `{ age: 1, name: 1 }` will be used for this query, making it more efficient than scanning the entire collection.

---

### **2. Multikey Indexes**

MongoDB supports **multikey indexes** for arrays. When an array field is indexed, MongoDB creates an index entry for each element in the array. This allows you to query based on any element in the array.

#### **Example: Creating a Multikey Index**

```js
db.users.createIndex({ hobbies: 1 });
```

If `hobbies` is an array field, MongoDB will create a multikey index on each value in the array. Queries that search for a specific hobby in the array will benefit from this index.

#### **Example of Querying with a Multikey Index**

```js
db.users.find({ hobbies: "reading" });
```

This query will efficiently find all users who have "reading" in their `hobbies` array, thanks to the multikey index.

#### **When to Use Multikey Indexes**:
- When you have array fields and you frequently query for specific values within those arrays.
- Be aware that a multikey index can only be created on fields that contain arrays. If the field contains non-array data, MongoDB will return an error.

---

### **3. Text Indexes**

MongoDB provides **text indexes** for full-text search capabilities. A text index allows you to perform text-based searches, which can include features like case-insensitive searches, word stemming, and phrase searching.

#### **Example: Creating a Text Index**

```js
db.articles.createIndex({ content: "text" });
```

This creates a text index on the `content` field of the `articles` collection.

#### **Querying with a Text Index**

You can perform text searches using the `$text` operator:

```js
db.articles.find({ $text: { $search: "mongodb" } });
```

This query will return all articles that contain the word "mongodb" in the `content` field. MongoDB's text search also supports phrases and Boolean operators.

#### **Text Search Features**:
- **Stemming**: Searches automatically recognize word stems (e.g., "running" and "runner" are treated as equivalent).
- **Case-Insensitive**: Text search in MongoDB is case-insensitive by default.
- **Stop Words**: Words like "the", "a", and "is" are ignored in text searches.
- **Phrase Search**: You can search for exact phrases by wrapping them in quotes.

#### **When to Use Text Indexes**:
- When you need to search for specific terms or phrases within large bodies of text, such as blog posts, documents, or product descriptions.
- Be aware that text indexes are not suitable for exact matches and should not be used on numeric or date fields.

### **4. Geospatial Indexes**

MongoDB supports **geospatial indexes** to efficiently store and query geographic coordinates. Geospatial queries are essential for location-based applications, such as finding nearby places, users, or events.

#### **Types of Geospatial Indexes**:
- **2d Index**: Suitable for flat, two-dimensional coordinates (e.g., latitude/longitude).
- **2dsphere Index**: Supports spherical geometry and is used for geospatial queries on a spherical surface (e.g., Earth).

#### **Example: Creating a Geospatial Index**

For a `locations` collection with `longitude` and `latitude`:

```js
db.locations.createIndex({ location: "2dsphere" });
```

Here, `location` is a field containing geospatial data (e.g., `GeoJSON` format).

#### **Querying with Geospatial Indexes**

You can perform geospatial queries such as finding nearby points:

```js
db.locations.find({
  location: {
    $nearSphere: {
      $geometry: { type: "Point", coordinates: [ -73.97, 40.77 ] },
      $maxDistance: 5000
    }
  }
});
```

This query will return locations within 5 kilometers (5000 meters) of the point `[-73.97, 40.77]`.

#### **When to Use Geospatial Indexes**:
- For applications involving geographic data, such as location-based services, maps, and navigation.
- Use `2dsphere` indexes when working with spherical coordinate systems like GPS coordinates.

### **5. Hashed Indexes**

A **hashed index** is used to index values in a hash format. Hashed indexes are typically used when you need to distribute data evenly across a sharded cluster or when you want to perform equality-based queries on a single field.

#### **Example: Creating a Hashed Index**

```js
db.users.createIndex({ userId: "hashed" });
```

Hashed indexes are useful for ensuring that documents are evenly distributed across shards in a sharded cluster.

#### **When to Use Hashed Indexes**:
- Use hashed indexes in sharded collections when you want to shard data based on the hash of a field (usually the shard key).
- Hashed indexes are optimized for equality queries, but they are not suitable for range queries or sorting.

---

### **6. Wildcard Indexes**

MongoDB 4.2 introduced **wildcard indexes** to allow indexing on all fields in a document, even when the structure of the documents is not consistent.

#### **Example: Creating a Wildcard Index**

```js
db.products.createIndex({ "$**": 1 });
```

This index will index all fields in the `products` collection, regardless of their names or data types. Wildcard indexes are particularly useful when you have documents with dynamic or unpredictable schemas.

#### **When to Use Wildcard Indexes**:
- When you have documents with fields that may vary in name or structure (e.g., dynamic schemas or logging data).
- Be aware that wildcard indexes can increase the storage requirements and may lead to slower performance if the documents have many fields.

---

### **7. TTL (Time-To-Live) Indexes**

A **TTL index** allows you to set an expiration time on documents. Once a documentâ€™s TTL has passed, MongoDB will automatically delete it. This is useful for applications that need to manage data that becomes irrelevant after a certain time, such as session data or cached information.

#### **Example: Creating a TTL Index**

```js
db.sessions.createIndex({ createdAt: 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 3600 });
```

In this case, the `createdAt` field is indexed, and documents will automatically expire one hour after the `createdAt` timestamp.

#### **When to Use TTL Indexes**:
- For managing time-sensitive data like sessions, logs, or cache.
- Be mindful of the performance impact if TTL indexes are applied to large datasets.

### **8. Indexing Strategies and Best Practices**

1. **Use Indexes Selectively**: Indexing all fields can lead to high storage overhead and slower write operations. Focus on indexing fields that are frequently queried.
2. **Compound Indexes**: Compound indexes are powerful but should be used carefully, ensuring the index order matches query patterns.
3. **Keep Indexes Updated**: Periodically review your indexes to ensure they match the query patterns and remove unused or redundant indexes.
4. **Analyze Queries**: Use the `.explain()` method to analyze query performance and see if indexes are being used efficiently.
5. **Consider Index Size**: Large indexes can take up significant memory. Consider the storage implications when designing your indexing strategy.
