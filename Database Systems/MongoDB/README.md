> MongoDB is a popular, open-source NoSQL database designed for high performance, scalability, and flexibility. Unlike traditional relational databases (RDBMS), MongoDB uses a document-oriented approach to store and manage data, making it particularly well-suited for applications dealing with large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.
