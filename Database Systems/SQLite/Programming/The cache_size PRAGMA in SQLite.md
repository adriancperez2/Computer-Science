The **`cache_size`** PRAGMA in SQLite is used to control the number of pages that SQLite keeps in memory for the database cache. The cache is used to store the database pages that are most recently read or written, to speed up database operations by reducing disk I/O.

### Syntax of `cache_size` PRAGMA

```sql
PRAGMA cache_size = size_in_pages;
```

- **`size_in_pages`**: The number of database pages to keep in memory for caching. A page is a fixed-size block of the database file (typically 1024, 2048, or 4096 bytes). The default cache size is determined by the SQLite configuration and can vary based on the platform, but it's typically around 2000 pages.

You can also query the current cache size using:

```sql
PRAGMA cache_size;
```

This will return the current number of pages used in the cache.

### Key Points

1. **Impact on Performance**:
   - A **larger cache** can improve performance, especially for read-heavy operations, by reducing the need to access the disk. However, this uses more memory.
   - A **smaller cache** can reduce memory usage but may result in slower database operations, as more data will need to be read from disk.

2. **Setting Cache Size**:
   - The value for `cache_size` is expressed in **number of pages**. To convert it into actual memory usage, you can multiply the number of pages by the page size (usually 1024, 2048, or 4096 bytes).
   
   For example, if you want to set the cache size to **1000 pages** and your page size is 1024 bytes, the memory used for the cache will be:

   ```text
   1000 pages * 1024 bytes = 1,024,000 bytes (1 MB)
   ```

3. **No Limit on Cache Size**:
   - You can set the cache size to a very large number, but it will be constrained by the available memory on your system. If the cache size exceeds the available memory, SQLite will attempt to use more memory, but performance may degrade if memory is exhausted.

4. **Default Cache Size**:
   - The default cache size is typically 2000 pages on most systems, which equates to about 2 MB of memory (assuming a page size of 1024 bytes). This can vary depending on the SQLite version and platform.

### Example 1: Setting Cache Size

To set the cache size to **5000 pages**:

```sql
PRAGMA cache_size = 5000;
```

This would set the cache to store 5000 pages in memory.

---

### Example 2: Checking Current Cache Size

To check the current cache size:

```sql
PRAGMA cache_size;
```

This will return the current number of pages used for caching.

Example output:

```
2000
```

This means that 2000 pages are currently being used for caching.

---

### Example 3: Setting Cache Size to a Smaller Value

To reduce the cache size to **1000 pages**:

```sql
PRAGMA cache_size = 1000;
```

This will decrease the memory used for caching, which might reduce memory consumption but could potentially slow down database operations that require frequent disk access.

---

### Example 4: Using Cache Size with a Larger Value

To increase the cache size to **10000 pages** (e.g., 10 MB with 1024-byte pages):

```sql
PRAGMA cache_size = 10000;
```

This will increase the number of pages stored in memory, which can improve performance for large databases or complex queries.

---

### Important Considerations

1. **Memory Usage**:
   - Larger cache sizes increase memory consumption. Ensure that the machine running SQLite has sufficient available RAM if you increase the cache size significantly.
   
2. **Database Size**:
   - For large databases or applications that require frequent querying, a larger cache size can help speed up performance by reducing disk I/O. However, this is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and the optimal cache size may depend on the database size, workload, and system resources.

3. **No Immediate Effect on Active Connections**:
   - The `cache_size` PRAGMA setting only affects the current database connection. It does not persist across multiple connections unless set again on each connection.

4. **Page Size**:
   - The size of the cache in memory depends on the database's page size. SQLite's default page size is typically 1024 bytes, but it can be configured to use other sizes like 2048 or 4096 bytes. The page size can be checked with `PRAGMA page_size`.

### Summary of `cache_size` PRAGMA

- **Purpose**: Controls the number of pages that SQLite keeps in memory for caching.
- **Syntax**: `PRAGMA cache_size = size_in_pages;`
- **Impact**: Larger cache sizes improve performance by reducing disk I/O, but at the cost of increased memory usage.
- **Default**: Typically 2000 pages, but varies based on the platform and SQLite version.
- **Usage**: Use the `cache_size` PRAGMA to tune performance for read-heavy workloads or when working with large databases.
