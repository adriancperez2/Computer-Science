In SQLite, **expressions** are used to compute values or manipulate data within queries. They are combinations of literals (constants), columns, operators, and functions that evaluate to a single value. Expressions can be used in various parts of a SQL statement, such as in the `SELECT` clause, `WHERE` clause, `ORDER BY`, and so on.

### Types of Expressions in SQLite

1. **Literal Expressions**
2. **Column Expressions**
3. **Arithmetic Expressions**
4. **String Expressions**
5. **Boolean Expressions**
6. **Date and Time Expressions**
7. **Aggregate Expressions**
8. **Subqueries as Expressions**
9. **CASE Expressions**

Let's break down each type of expression.

---

### 1. **Literal Expressions**

A **literal** is a fixed value directly provided in the query. These values can be numbers, strings, dates, etc.

- **Numeric literals**: `123`, `3.14`
- **String literals**: `'Hello'`, `'SQLite'`
- **NULL literals**: `NULL`

#### Example:

```sql
SELECT 100 + 25 AS result;
```

This expression evaluates to `125`.

---

### 2. **Column Expressions**

Column expressions refer to the columns of a table and can be used directly in queries. These columns can be combined with operators and functions to produce new values.

#### Example:

```sql
SELECT name, age + 5 AS new_age
FROM users;
```

This expression calculates a new age by adding 5 to the existing `age` column for each user.

---

### 3. **Arithmetic Expressions**

Arithmetic expressions involve performing arithmetic operations on numbers or columns. These expressions use arithmetic operators such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.

#### Example:

```sql
SELECT price * quantity AS total_price
FROM orders;
```

This expression multiplies the `price` and `quantity` columns to calculate the `total_price` for each order.

You can also use parentheses to group operations and control the order of evaluation:

```sql
SELECT (price * quantity) - discount AS net_price
FROM orders;
```

---

### 4. **String Expressions**

String expressions involve operations on string values, such as concatenation or pattern matching.

- **Concatenation**: In SQLite, you use the `||` operator to concatenate two or more strings.

#### Example:

```sql
SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name
FROM employees;
```

This expression concatenates the `first_name` and `last_name` columns with a space in between to create a `full_name`.

- **String Functions**: You can use SQLite string functions, such as `UPPER()`, `LOWER()`, `SUBSTR()`, etc., as part of string expressions.

#### Example:

```sql
SELECT UPPER(name) AS uppercase_name
FROM users;
```

This expression converts the `name` column to uppercase.

---

### 5. **Boolean Expressions**

Boolean expressions return a `TRUE`, `FALSE`, or `NULL` value, and are often used in `WHERE` clauses or `CASE` statements.

- **Comparison operators** like `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=` help create boolean expressions.
- **Logical operators** like `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` are used to combine or negate boolean expressions.

#### Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE age >= 18 AND age <= 30;
```

This boolean expression filters the rows to only include users whose `age` is between 18 and 30 (inclusive).

---

### 6. **Date and Time Expressions**

SQLite provides functions for working with date and time. You can perform arithmetic operations and format dates using functions like `DATE()`, `TIME()`, `DATETIME()`, and `CURRENT_DATE`.

#### Example:

```sql
SELECT name, birthdate, 
       (strftime('%Y', 'now') - strftime('%Y', birthdate)) AS age
FROM users;
```

This expression calculates the user's age by subtracting the year part of their `birthdate` from the current year.

- **`strftime('%Y', date)`** extracts the year part of the date.

---

### 7. **Aggregate Expressions**

Aggregate expressions involve functions that perform calculations on a set of rows and return a single result.

- **`COUNT()`**: Counts the number of rows.
- **`SUM()`**: Calculates the sum of values.
- **`AVG()`**: Calculates the average of values.
- **`MIN()` and `MAX()`**: Return the minimum or maximum value.

#### Example:

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

This expression calculates the average salary for each department by using the `AVG()` function, and the `GROUP BY` clause groups rows by `department`.

---

### 8. **Subqueries as Expressions**

A **subquery** is a query embedded inside another query. Subqueries can return a single value and be used as expressions in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `HAVING`, or `FROM` clauses.

#### Example:

```sql
SELECT name, age
FROM users
WHERE age > (SELECT AVG(age) FROM users);
```

This query uses a subquery to compare each user's `age` to the average age of all users. The subquery returns the average age, and the outer query retrieves users older than the average age.

---

### 9. **CASE Expressions**

The `CASE` expression in SQLite allows you to implement conditional logic in SQL. It's similar to an `IF-ELSE` statement in programming.

#### Example:

```sql
SELECT name, age,
       CASE 
           WHEN age < 18 THEN 'Minor'
           WHEN age >= 18 THEN 'Adult'
           ELSE 'Unknown'
       END AS age_group
FROM users;
```

This expression categorizes users into `Minor` and `Adult` based on their `age`.

- The `CASE` expression checks conditions and returns a value depending on which condition is true.

### Summary of Common SQLite Expressions

- **Literal Expressions**: Fixed values such as numbers, strings, or `NULL`.
- **Column Expressions**: Referencing table columns in queries.
- **Arithmetic Expressions**: Operations on numbers or columns (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication).
- **String Expressions**: Operations on strings, including concatenation (`||`) and functions like `UPPER()` and `LOWER()`.
- **Boolean Expressions**: Comparison and logical expressions (e.g., `=`, `>`, `AND`, `OR`).
- **Date and Time Expressions**: Working with dates and times using functions like `DATE()`, `CURRENT_DATE`, and `strftime()`.
- **Aggregate Expressions**: Functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()`.
- **Subqueries as Expressions**: Using nested queries to return values in the main query.
- **CASE Expressions**: Implementing conditional logic with `CASE`.

Expressions in SQLite are versatile and essential for performing calculations, transforming data, and adding conditional logic to queries. They make SQL more powerful and flexible, enabling complex queries and efficient data manipulation.
