The **`GLOB`** clause in SQLite is used for pattern matching, similar to the **`LIKE`** clause, but it uses **wildcards** in a different way. The `GLOB` operator performs pattern matching based on **Unix-style glob patterns**, which are different from the SQL pattern matching syntax used by the `LIKE` clause.

In `GLOB`, the wildcard characters used are:

- **`*`**: Matches **zero or more characters** (similar to `%` in `LIKE`).
- **`?`**: Matches **exactly one character** (similar to `_` in `LIKE`).
- **`[]`**: Matches any one character within the **brackets** (this is similar to regular expressions).

### Syntax of the `GLOB` Clause

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table
WHERE column_name GLOB pattern;
```

- **`column_name`**: The column you want to search within.
- **`pattern`**: The glob pattern you're using for matching.

### Differences Between `LIKE` and `GLOB`

1. **Case Sensitivity**: 
   - `GLOB` is **case-sensitive** by default, while `LIKE` is **case-insensitive** for ASCII characters.
   - You can modify case sensitivity for `LIKE` with `COLLATE`, but `GLOB` is case-sensitive in SQLite, so itâ€™s important to account for this when querying.

2. **Wildcards**:
   - In `LIKE`, the `%` and `_` wildcards are used, while in `GLOB`, the `*` and `?` wildcards are used.
   - Additionally, `GLOB` allows the use of brackets (`[]`) to match specific characters, which is not possible with `LIKE`.

### Example 1: Using `GLOB` with the `*` Wildcard

If you want to match strings that start with "J" and have any number of characters after it, you can use the `*` wildcard in `GLOB`. For example, to find all employees whose names start with "J":

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE name GLOB 'J*';
```

This query will return all employees whose `name` starts with "J" and can be followed by any sequence of characters (including no characters at all).

---

### Example 2: Using `GLOB` with the `?` Wildcard

To match a name with exactly three characters, where the first character is "J" and the second and third characters can be any character, you can use the `?` wildcard:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE name GLOB 'J??';
```

This query will return all employees whose `name` has exactly three characters, with the first character being "J".

---

### Example 3: Using `GLOB` with Character Ranges (`[]`)

You can also use **`[]`** to match any single character from a set of characters. For example, to find all employees whose names start with "J" and have the second character as either "a", "e", or "o", you can use:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE name GLOB 'J[aeo]*';
```

This query will return all employees whose `name` starts with "J" and the second character is either "a", "e", or "o".

---

### Example 4: Case Sensitivity with `GLOB`

Because `GLOB` is case-sensitive by default, searching for `name GLOB 'j%'` will **not** match names starting with "J". For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE name GLOB 'j*';
```

This will only match names starting with a lowercase "j", not an uppercase "J". If you want case-insensitive matching, you would need to convert the string to lowercase using the `LOWER()` function:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE LOWER(name) GLOB 'j*';
```

This will perform a case-insensitive match for names starting with "j".

---

### Example 5: Using `GLOB` with Exclusion

You can also use `NOT GLOB` to exclude rows that match a pattern. For example, to find all employees whose names do not start with "J":

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE name NOT GLOB 'J*';
```

This query will return all employees whose `name` does not start with "J".

### Summary of `GLOB` Usage

- **`GLOB`** is used for pattern matching with Unix-style glob patterns.
- The **wildcards** used in `GLOB` are:
  - **`*`**: Matches zero or more characters (similar to `%` in `LIKE`).
  - **`?`**: Matches exactly one character (similar to `_` in `LIKE`).
  - **`[]`**: Matches any one character within the brackets.
- **Case Sensitivity**: `GLOB` is **case-sensitive** by default, unlike `LIKE` which is usually case-insensitive.
- **`NOT GLOB`**: You can use `NOT GLOB` to exclude patterns from the results.

#### Examples:
- `GLOB 'J*'`: Matches any value starting with "J".
- `GLOB 'J??'`: Matches any value starting with "J" and having exactly two more characters.
- `GLOB 'J[aeo]*'`: Matches any value starting with "J" and the second character being "a", "e", or "o".

`GLOB` is a powerful tool for pattern matching when you need case-sensitive searches or want to use the flexibility of Unix-style pattern matching.
