SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, self-contained SQL database engine widely used in applications that require a local database. Unlike other SQL databases, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, which are server-based, SQLite is embedded directly into the application. This makes it simple to set up, with no configuration or separate server process required, and it reads and writes to ordinary disk files.

Here's a breakdown of SQLite’s key features:

1. **Serverless Architecture**  
   - SQLite does not require a server to run; it directly reads and writes data to a regular file on disk. This simplicity makes it ideal for applications that need an integrated database.

2. **Self-Contained and Lightweight**  
   - SQLite is a single library, making it extremely compact and efficient. It doesn’t rely on external dependencies, which reduces the complexity of installing and managing the database.

3. **Zero Configuration**  
   - No configuration is necessary for SQLite to work. You just open a database file, and it’s ready to go. This zero-setup quality is beneficial for embedded applications, mobile apps, and small-scale applications.

4. **ACID Compliance**  
   - SQLite follows the principles of Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID), which ensures data integrity even in cases of crashes or power loss.

5. **Cross-Platform**  
   - SQLite databases are cross-platform compatible, meaning you can move the database file between systems with different architectures, and it will still work as expected.

6. **Commonly Used in Mobile and Embedded Applications**  
   - SQLite is popular in mobile apps, IoT devices, and desktop applications. It’s the default database for Android and iOS applications, as well as web browsers, including Chrome and Firefox.

7. **SQL Standard Compliance with Limitations**  
   - SQLite supports a large subset of SQL, but it has some limitations (such as no support for `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` or complex stored procedures) due to its lightweight nature.

### When to Use SQLite
SQLite is best suited for situations where:
   - You need a database without the overhead of a server.
   - You’re working with small to medium-sized datasets.
   - You’re developing for mobile, desktop, or embedded systems.

SQLite may not be the best choice for high-concurrency, large-scale systems, or applications with complex data requirements, where a full-scale relational database management system (RDBMS) may perform better.
