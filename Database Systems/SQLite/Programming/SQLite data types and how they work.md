SQLite is unique among SQL databases because it uses a dynamic typing system rather than enforcing strict data types for columns. SQLite columns can hold various data types, but SQLite generally recognizes a limited set of "storage classes" (internal types) rather than enforcing strict types like `INTEGER` or `TEXT`. Here’s a breakdown of SQLite data types and how they work.

### SQLite Storage Classes

SQLite organizes data into five primary storage classes:

1. **NULL**: Represents a null or missing value.
2. **INTEGER**: A signed integer, stored in 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 bytes depending on the value's magnitude.
3. **REAL**: A floating-point value, stored as an 8-byte IEEE floating point number.
4. **TEXT**: Text strings, stored using the database encoding (UTF-8, UTF-16LE, or UTF-16BE).
5. **BLOB**: Binary Large Object data, stored exactly as it is input (binary data).

### Declaring Column Types

While SQLite uses the storage classes above, you can specify column "affinities" (or type hints) when creating tables. These affinities tell SQLite how to handle data, but SQLite is flexible and may store values differently depending on the data inserted. 

**Examples of Common Column Type Affinities:**

- **INTEGER**: Used for whole numbers, typically for primary keys or counts.
- **REAL**: Used for floating-point numbers, like prices or measurements.
- **TEXT**: Used for text strings, like names or addresses.
- **BLOB**: Used for binary data, like images or files.

SQLite will try to match the declared type with one of the following four type affinities:

1. **INTEGER**: Columns with names containing "INT" typically have integer affinity.
2. **TEXT**: Columns with "CHAR", "CLOB", or "TEXT" in the type name have text affinity.
3. **REAL**: Columns with "REAL", "FLOA", or "DOUB" are given real affinity.
4. **NUMERIC**: Columns not falling under the previous categories default to numeric affinity, which allows storage as integer, real, or text.

### SQLite Type Affinity Examples

| Declared Type | Type Affinity |
|---------------|---------------|
| `INTEGER`     | INTEGER       |
| `VARCHAR(255)`| TEXT          |
| `BOOLEAN`     | NUMERIC       |
| `DECIMAL`     | NUMERIC       |
| `BLOB`        | BLOB          |
| `TEXT`        | TEXT          |
| `REAL`        | REAL          |

### Example Table with Various Data Types

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    price REAL,
    quantity INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    description TEXT,
    image BLOB
);
```

In this example:
- **`product_id`** is an `INTEGER` type, often used for primary keys.
- **`name`** is of type `TEXT`, suitable for strings.
- **`price`** is a `REAL` type for floating-point numbers.
- **`quantity`** is an `INTEGER` with a default value of `0`.
- **`description`** is a `TEXT` type for long text fields.
- **`image`** is a `BLOB` type, suitable for binary data.

### SQLite Dynamic Typing and Type Flexibility

Unlike other databases, SQLite is flexible with data types:

- **Automatic Type Conversion**: When data is inserted, SQLite may convert it to a different storage class if the data type does not match the column affinity.
  
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO products (product_id, name, price) VALUES (1, 'Widget', '9.99');
  ```
  Here, SQLite will store `"9.99"` as a `REAL` number `9.99` due to the column's `REAL` affinity.

- **Accepting Different Types in Columns**: SQLite allows columns to store any type of data, regardless of the declared type affinity. For example, an `INTEGER` column can hold `TEXT` data if you explicitly insert it.

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO products (product_id, name, price) VALUES (2, 'Gadget', 'TextInsteadOfNumber');
  ```

### Common SQLite Data Type Affinities

SQLite allows a wide range of column declarations with flexible interpretations:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sample (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,   -- INTEGER affinity
    name TEXT,                -- TEXT affinity
    price REAL,               -- REAL affinity
    discount NUMERIC,         -- NUMERIC affinity (can store integer, real, or text)
    image BLOB                -- BLOB affinity
);
```

### Tips for Working with SQLite Data Types

1. **Use Appropriate Affinity Names**: Stick to common names like `INTEGER`, `REAL`, `TEXT`, and `BLOB` to make your database easier to understand.
2. **Primary Key Requirement**: SQLite requires the primary key to have `INTEGER` affinity if it’s set to `AUTOINCREMENT`.
3. **Beware of Loose Typing**: SQLite’s flexibility allows data of unexpected types, so check constraints carefully if strict data types are important in your application.
4. **Boolean Data**: SQLite does not have a native `BOOLEAN` type, but you can use `INTEGER` and store `0` for `false` and `1` for `true`.

### Summary

SQLite’s data types (or affinities) give it flexibility and ease of use in various applications. By understanding and using these types effectively, you can manage SQLite databases in a way that aligns with traditional SQL practices while leveraging SQLite's flexibility.
