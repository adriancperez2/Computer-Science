The **`encoding`** PRAGMA in SQLite is used to get or set the text encoding for the database. SQLite supports different text encodings for storing string data. By default, SQLite uses **UTF-8** encoding, but you can configure it to use **UTF-16** encoding if needed.

### Syntax of `encoding` PRAGMA

```sql
PRAGMA encoding = { "UTF-8" | "UTF-16" };
```

- **`UTF-8`**: Sets the database encoding to UTF-8. This is the default encoding for SQLite databases. It is a variable-width character encoding for Unicode, and it is efficient in terms of storage for ASCII characters.
  
- **`UTF-16`**: Sets the database encoding to UTF-16. This encoding uses a fixed width of 16 bits (2 bytes) for each character, and it can represent all Unicode characters, but it consumes more space for characters that fit in UTF-8.

### Querying the Current Encoding

To check the current encoding of the database, you can use the following PRAGMA:

```sql
PRAGMA encoding;
```

This will return the current encoding used by the database (either `UTF-8` or `UTF-16`).

### Example 1: Setting the Encoding to UTF-16

To set the encoding of the database to **UTF-16**:

```sql
PRAGMA encoding = "UTF-16";
```

This will change the encoding to UTF-16 for the current session. All text stored in the database will now be in UTF-16 encoding.

### Example 2: Querying the Encoding

To check the current encoding:

```sql
PRAGMA encoding;
```

This will return the encoding being used. If the encoding was changed to UTF-16, it will return `"UTF-16"`.

### Important Notes

1. **Changing Encoding**: The encoding of an SQLite database can only be set **at the time of database creation**. It is not possible to change the encoding of an existing database after it has been created. If you need to change the encoding of an existing database, you would need to:
   - Create a new database with the desired encoding.
   - Copy the data from the old database to the new one.

2. **Database Creation**: The encoding is specified when creating a new database. If no encoding is specified, SQLite uses the default encoding of **UTF-8**.

   For example, to create a new database with UTF-16 encoding, you would use:

   ```sql
   PRAGMA encoding = "UTF-16";
   CREATE DATABASE my_database;
   ```

3. **UTF-8 vs. UTF-16**:
   - **UTF-8** is generally more space-efficient, especially for databases that primarily store ASCII text, as characters in the ASCII range only require 1 byte.
   - **UTF-16** is more space-consuming for ASCII characters (because each character takes 2 bytes), but it is sometimes preferred when the database needs to store more non-ASCII characters (like those in languages that require more than 1 byte in UTF-8).

4. **Compatibility**: Be cautious when working with different SQLite databases with different encodings. While SQLite supports both UTF-8 and UTF-16, using a single encoding throughout the system is recommended for consistency.

### Summary of `encoding` PRAGMA

- **Purpose**: Specifies the text encoding (UTF-8 or UTF-16) used by the SQLite database.
- **Syntax**: `PRAGMA encoding = { "UTF-8" | "UTF-16" };`
  - **`UTF-8`**: Default encoding, more space-efficient for ASCII text.
  - **`UTF-16`**: Fixed-width encoding, requires more space, but may be preferred for certain character sets.
- **Querying**: Use `PRAGMA encoding;` to check the current encoding.
- **Limitation**: You can only set the encoding when creating a new database. Changing the encoding of an existing database requires creating a new one and migrating data.
