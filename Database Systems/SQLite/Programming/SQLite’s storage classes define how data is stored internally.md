SQLite’s storage classes define how data is stored internally. Unlike many other SQL databases, SQLite uses a dynamic typing system with five primary storage classes rather than enforcing strict column data types. Each storage class determines how values are represented internally, offering flexibility for storing different data types in a single column.

### The Five SQLite Storage Classes

1. **NULL**
   - Represents missing or undefined values.
   - Used when a column does not have a value.
   - Stored as a unique placeholder within SQLite, consuming minimal space.

2. **INTEGER**
   - Represents signed integer values.
   - Stored in 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 bytes, depending on the value’s size.
   - Can store values from -2^63 to +2^63-1.
   - Often used for counting, IDs, and fields with integer values.

3. **REAL**
   - Represents floating-point values.
   - Stored as an 8-byte IEEE floating point number.
   - Useful for precise numeric data, like measurements, scientific values, or prices.

4. **TEXT**
   - Represents string data.
   - Stored using the database encoding: UTF-8, UTF-16LE, or UTF-16BE.
   - Suitable for storing any text, from short identifiers to long descriptions.
   - Commonly used for names, addresses, and other textual data.

5. **BLOB** (Binary Large Object)
   - Stores raw binary data.
   - Stored exactly as input without any modifications.
   - Useful for images, files, or any data that must be stored in binary form.
   - Can contain any type of data, with SQLite treating it as a raw sequence of bytes.

### Examples of SQLite Storage Classes in Action

Suppose we have a table `media_files` for storing multimedia information. Here’s how you might use each storage class:

```sql
CREATE TABLE media_files (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,       -- INTEGER storage class
    file_name TEXT,               -- TEXT storage class
    file_size INTEGER,            -- INTEGER storage class
    duration REAL,                -- REAL storage class
    file_data BLOB,               -- BLOB storage class
    last_accessed NULL            -- NULL storage class
);
```

1. **`id`**: Uses the `INTEGER` storage class, often as the primary key.
2. **`file_name`**: Uses the `TEXT` storage class to store a file’s name.
3. **`file_size`**: Uses the `INTEGER` storage class for the file’s size in bytes.
4. **`duration`**: Uses the `REAL` storage class to represent a multimedia file’s duration in seconds.
5. **`file_data`**: Uses the `BLOB` storage class to store the actual file data.
6. **`last_accessed`**: Can use the `NULL` storage class if no last-accessed date is known.

### SQLite’s Flexible Typing System

SQLite's use of storage classes allows columns to hold different types of data, even if they were created with a specific affinity (or type hint). For example, a column with an `INTEGER` affinity might hold `TEXT` or `REAL` values. This flexibility is due to SQLite’s “type affinity” system, which tries to store values in the intended type whenever possible but doesn’t enforce it strictly.

**Example of Flexible Typing**:

```sql
INSERT INTO media_files (id, file_name, file_size, duration, file_data) VALUES
    (1, 'song.mp3', 2048000, '3.5', X'89504E47'),
    (2, 'video.mp4', '5000000', 2.7, NULL);
```

In this example:
- The `duration` column has `REAL` affinity but could accept `TEXT` and automatically convert `3.5` to a floating point.
- The `file_size` column has `INTEGER` affinity but could accept `TEXT` like `'5000000'`.

### Summary

SQLite storage classes (NULL, INTEGER, REAL, TEXT, BLOB) provide flexibility and simplicity, allowing SQLite to adapt to various data types while maintaining efficient storage. This dynamic typing system makes SQLite powerful for applications where data types might not always conform strictly, such as mobile apps or embedded devices. Understanding these storage classes can help you use SQLite to its fullest, storing and managing diverse types of data efficiently.
