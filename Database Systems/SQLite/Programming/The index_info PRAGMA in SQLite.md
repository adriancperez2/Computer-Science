The **`index_info`** PRAGMA in SQLite is used to retrieve detailed information about the columns in a specific index within a database table. This can be helpful when you need to inspect the structure of an index, understand its configuration, or debug performance issues related to indexing.

### Syntax of `index_info` PRAGMA

```sql
PRAGMA index_info(index_name);
```

- **`index_name`**: The name of the index you want information about. You can find the name of an index by checking the schema or using the `PRAGMA index_list` command on a table.

### Output of `index_info`

Running this PRAGMA returns a result set with the following columns:

1. **`seqno`**: The sequence number of the column in the index. This starts from `0` for the first column in the index, `1` for the second, and so on.
2. **`cid`**: The column ID within the table that this index entry refers to. `-1` means the indexed column is an expression or not directly associated with a single table column.
3. **`name`**: The name of the column in the table that is part of the index. If itâ€™s an expression index, this may contain the expression itself.

### Example Usage of `index_info`

Suppose we have a table `employees` with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    department TEXT,
    salary REAL
);
```

And we create an index on the `name` and `department` columns:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name_dept ON employees (name, department);
```

To get information about the columns in this index, we would use:

```sql
PRAGMA index_info('idx_employee_name_dept');
```

This would return a result set like:

| seqno | cid | name       |
|-------|-----|------------|
| 0     | 1   | name       |
| 1     | 2   | department |

This result shows:

- **`seqno`**: The order of columns in the index. Here, `name` is the first column in the index (seqno 0), and `department` is the second (seqno 1).
- **`cid`**: The column ID within the `employees` table. For example, `name` has `cid` 1 and `department` has `cid` 2.
- **`name`**: The name of each indexed column, showing that the index covers `name` and `department`.

### Practical Uses of `index_info`

1. **Understanding Index Composition**: Use `index_info` to inspect which columns an index covers, their order, and how the index is structured.
  
2. **Debugging Performance**: When tuning queries, checking the columns in an index helps confirm that indexes are set up as expected and covers columns in the correct order for optimal query performance.

3. **Working with Expression Indexes**: For more complex indexes, such as expression indexes, the `name` field may contain the expression used in the index. This helps verify the exact expressions or derived columns included in an index.

### Related PRAGMAs

- **`PRAGMA index_list(table_name)`**: Returns a list of all indexes on a specific table.
- **`PRAGMA index_xinfo(index_name)`**: Similar to `index_info` but provides additional details, such as whether a column is a descending index or if the column is an expression.

### Summary of `index_info` PRAGMA

- **Purpose**: Retrieves information about the columns in a specified index, including the sequence order, column ID, and column names.
- **Syntax**: `PRAGMA index_info(index_name);`
- **Use Cases**: Useful for examining index composition, debugging query performance, and understanding the structure of expression indexes.
