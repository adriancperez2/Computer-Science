In SQLite, the **`TRUNCATE TABLE`** command is **not supported** directly. Unlike other relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, where `TRUNCATE TABLE` is a fast way to delete all rows from a table, SQLite does not have a built-in `TRUNCATE` command.

### Workaround for `TRUNCATE` in SQLite

Since `TRUNCATE` is not supported, you can achieve similar functionality in SQLite using one of the following approaches:

#### 1. **Using `DELETE` Without a `WHERE` Clause**

The simplest way to remove all rows from a table in SQLite is to use the `DELETE` statement without a `WHERE` clause. This will delete all records but keep the table structure intact.

**Syntax**:
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
```

**Example**:
```sql
DELETE FROM employees;
```

**Explanation**: This will delete all rows in the `employees` table. However, note that:
- It **does not reset** the primary key auto-increment counter (if the table has an `AUTOINCREMENT` column).
- It can be slower than `TRUNCATE` in other RDBMS, especially for large tables.

#### 2. **Using `DROP` and `CREATE` (For Complete Reset)**

If you want to delete all rows and also reset any auto-increment counters, you can drop the table and recreate it. This is a more drastic approach that removes the table and then redefines it from scratch.

**Syntax**:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS table_name;
CREATE TABLE table_name (...);
```

**Example**:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employees;
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT,
    department_id INTEGER,
    hire_date DATE
);
```

**Explanation**: This approach:
- Drops the `employees` table.
- Recreates the table with the original schema.
- Resets the auto-increment counter.

This method is effectively like `TRUNCATE` because it clears all data and resets the structure, but it also removes the table schema, which can be a downside if you have indexes, triggers, or other dependencies tied to the table.

#### 3. **Using `VACUUM` After Deleting All Rows**

Once you've deleted all rows using `DELETE`, you can run the `VACUUM` command to release unused space and defragment the database. This is similar to the optimization you get with `TRUNCATE` in other databases.

**Syntax**:
```sql
VACUUM;
```

**Example**:
```sql
DELETE FROM employees;
VACUUM;
```

**Explanation**: 
- The `DELETE FROM` removes the rows.
- The `VACUUM` command rebuilds the database file, freeing up unused space.
  
While `VACUUM` does not completely reset the table (e.g., it does not reset auto-increment values), it optimizes the database after deletion.

### Key Differences from `TRUNCATE` in Other RDBMS

- **Performance**: `TRUNCATE` in systems like MySQL is often faster than `DELETE` because it doesnâ€™t log individual row deletions. In SQLite, `DELETE` logs each row removal, which can be slower for large tables.
- **Resetting Auto-Increment Counter**: `TRUNCATE` in systems like MySQL resets the auto-increment counter. In SQLite, you have to manually handle this if needed.
- **No Rollback on `TRUNCATE`**: In some databases, `TRUNCATE` is a non-logged operation and cannot be rolled back if executed outside of a transaction. `DELETE` in SQLite is fully logged and can be rolled back within a transaction.

### Conclusion

- SQLite does not support the `TRUNCATE TABLE` command.
- To delete all rows from a table, you can use `DELETE FROM table_name;`.
- For resetting auto-increment values or clearing the entire schema, you can use `DROP TABLE` followed by `CREATE TABLE`.
- You can optimize the database after deletion with the `VACUUM` command.

Each of these approaches has its own advantages and limitations, so the right choice depends on your specific needs, such as performance, auto-increment management, and table schema handling.
