In SQLite, the `INSERT` query is used to add new records (rows) into an existing table. You can insert data into one or more columns of the table, depending on the structure of the table and the data you're adding.

### Syntax of the `INSERT INTO` Query

The basic syntax for inserting data into a table is as follows:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) 
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

- **`table_name`**: The name of the table into which you want to insert the data.
- **`column1, column2, ...`**: A list of columns where you want to insert the data. The order of columns should match the order of values you provide in the `VALUES` clause.
- **`value1, value2, ...`**: The actual values to be inserted into the columns.

If you're inserting data into **all** columns of the table (and in the correct order), you can omit the column names in the `INSERT INTO` clause.

### Example 1: Inserting Data into a Table

Let's say you have a table `users` with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    age INTEGER
);
```

To insert a new user into the `users` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, age) 
VALUES ('Alice', 30);
```

This command inserts a new row into the `users` table with the name "Alice" and age 30. The `id` column will automatically be assigned a unique value because it's defined as the `PRIMARY KEY` (and will auto-increment by default).

---

### Example 2: Inserting Data Without Specifying Columns

If you're inserting data into all columns of the table, you can omit the column names:

```sql
INSERT INTO users 
VALUES (NULL, 'Bob', 25);
```

- Here, `NULL` is inserted into the `id` column, and it will automatically be assigned a unique value (thanks to the auto-increment behavior).
- `Bob` is inserted into the `name` column, and `25` is inserted into the `age` column.

---

### Example 3: Inserting Multiple Rows at Once

You can insert multiple rows in a single `INSERT` statement:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, age) 
VALUES ('Charlie', 22), 
       ('David', 28), 
       ('Eve', 35);
```

This inserts three rows into the `users` table in one go.

---

### Example 4: Inserting Data Using Subqueries

You can also use a `SELECT` statement (subquery) to insert data from one table into another. For example, inserting data from a `temporary_users` table into the `users` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, age)
SELECT name, age
FROM temporary_users
WHERE age > 18;
```

In this case:
- The `SELECT` query fetches the `name` and `age` from the `temporary_users` table where the `age` is greater than 18.
- The results of the `SELECT` query are inserted into the `users` table.

---

### Example 5: Inserting Data with Default Values

If a table has columns with default values (e.g., a `timestamp` column), you can omit them from the `INSERT` statement, and SQLite will automatically use the default values. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    price REAL NOT NULL,
    created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

Now, when inserting data, you can omit the `created_at` column, and SQLite will automatically insert the current timestamp:

```sql
INSERT INTO products (product_name, price)
VALUES ('Laptop', 999.99);
```

SQLite will insert the current date and time in the `created_at` column, using the default value `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`.

---

### Example 6: Using `INSERT OR REPLACE`

SQLite provides an `INSERT OR REPLACE` variant that is used when you want to insert a new record or replace an existing record if it violates a unique constraint (usually on a primary key or unique key column).

```sql
INSERT OR REPLACE INTO users (id, name, age) 
VALUES (1, 'Alice', 31);
```

- This will insert a new row if the `id` doesnâ€™t already exist in the `users` table.
- If a row with `id = 1` already exists, it will be replaced with the new values (`'Alice'` and `31` in this case).

---

### Example 7: Using `INSERT OR IGNORE`

If you want to insert a record but ignore it if it already exists (based on a unique constraint), you can use `INSERT OR IGNORE`:

```sql
INSERT OR IGNORE INTO users (id, name, age) 
VALUES (1, 'Alice', 30);
```

- This command will insert the row only if the `id` value does not already exist in the table. If `id = 1` already exists, the operation is ignored.

---

### Summary

The `INSERT` statement in SQLite is a versatile and powerful command used to add data to a table. It supports:
- Inserting data into specific columns or all columns.
- Inserting multiple rows at once.
- Using subqueries to insert data from other tables.
- Handling default values, and using variations like `INSERT OR REPLACE` or `INSERT OR IGNORE` to manage unique constraints.

By understanding these different use cases, you can effectively insert data into your SQLite database to suit various requirements.
