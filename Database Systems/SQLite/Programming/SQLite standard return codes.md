SQLite has a set of standardized return codes that indicate the status of operations. These codes help developers diagnose and handle different outcomes of SQL statements and database operations. Here are some of the most common SQLite return codes and their meanings:

---

### 1. **Successful Operation Codes**

- **`SQLITE_OK` (0)**: Operation completed successfully without errors.
- **`SQLITE_DONE` (101)**: Statement execution completed, often used with `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations to indicate that the statement finished.
- **`SQLITE_ROW` (100)**: There are more rows available to retrieve in the result set. Typically used with `SELECT` statements.

---

### 2. **Error Codes**

#### General Errors

- **`SQLITE_ERROR` (1)**: Generic error indicating an unspecified SQL error or missing database.
- **`SQLITE_INTERNAL` (2)**: An internal error occurred, suggesting a flaw in SQLite itself (rare).
- **`SQLITE_PERM` (3)**: Permission denied, usually due to file permissions preventing access to the database file.
- **`SQLITE_ABORT` (4)**: Operation was aborted, usually by an application request or interruption.
- **`SQLITE_BUSY` (5)**: Database file is locked, typically because itâ€™s being accessed by another process.
- **`SQLITE_LOCKED` (6)**: A table in the database is locked, usually due to a conflict with another transaction.

#### Data Errors

- **`SQLITE_NOMEM` (7)**: SQLite ran out of memory while executing the statement.
- **`SQLITE_READONLY` (8)**: Attempted to write to a read-only database.
- **`SQLITE_INTERRUPT` (9)**: Operation was interrupted by a call to `sqlite3_interrupt()`.
- **`SQLITE_IOERR` (10)**: I/O error occurred while trying to read or write the database file.

---

### 3. **Constraint Violations**

- **`SQLITE_CONSTRAINT` (19)**: A constraint violation occurred, such as a `UNIQUE` or `NOT NULL` constraint. Common sub-errors include:
  - **`SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_UNIQUE`**: Unique constraint failed (duplicate value).
  - **`SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_PRIMARYKEY`**: Primary key constraint failed.
  - **`SQLITE_CONSTRAINT_FOREIGNKEY`**: Foreign key constraint violation.

---

### 4. **Authorization Errors**

- **`SQLITE_AUTH` (23)**: Authorization failure, typically because the action was denied by an authorization callback function.

---

### 5. **Database Corruption Errors**

- **`SQLITE_CORRUPT` (11)**: The database file is malformed or corrupted. This error usually means that the database needs to be repaired or restored from a backup.
  
---

### 6. **Data-Type Errors**

- **`SQLITE_MISMATCH` (20)**: Data type mismatch occurred. For example, trying to insert text data into an integer column.

---

### 7. **Schema Errors**

- **`SQLITE_SCHEMA` (17)**: Schema has changed, typically due to another process modifying the database schema while a statement is running.

---

### 8. **Range and Argument Errors**

- **`SQLITE_RANGE` (25)**: Index or parameter out of range, often occurring with bound parameters.
- **`SQLITE_MISUSE` (21)**: SQLite was used incorrectly. This often happens when using SQLite functions in the wrong order or calling functions in ways not supported by the API.

---

### 9. **Warning Codes**

- **`SQLITE_NOTICE` (27)**: Notification of some action that may require attention, often due to truncation of strings.
- **`SQLITE_WARNING` (28)**: A more serious warning than `SQLITE_NOTICE`, often used to alert users of potential issues.

These codes are invaluable for diagnosing issues when executing SQL commands, allowing developers to manage error handling and debugging in SQLite applications effectively.
