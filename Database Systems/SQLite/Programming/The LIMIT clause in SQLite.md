The **`LIMIT`** clause in SQLite is used to specify the maximum number of rows that should be returned by a query. It helps in controlling the size of the result set, making it especially useful for limiting data when working with large datasets or when you only need a subset of records.

### Syntax of the `LIMIT` Clause

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table
WHERE condition
LIMIT number_of_rows;
```

- **`columns`**: The columns you want to select.
- **`table`**: The table from which to retrieve the data.
- **`condition`**: Optional filter using a `WHERE` clause to narrow down the results.
- **`number_of_rows`**: The maximum number of rows to be returned.

### Example 1: Using `LIMIT` to Control the Number of Rows

For instance, if you have a table `employees` and you want to select only the first 5 rows:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
LIMIT 5;
```

This query will return only the first 5 rows from the `employees` table. If there are fewer than 5 rows in the table, it will return all available rows.

### Example 2: Using `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` for Specific Results

When using `LIMIT`, it's common to combine it with the `ORDER BY` clause to retrieve a specific subset of rows, such as the top or bottom rows based on some criteria.

For example, to get the top 3 highest-paid employees from the `employees` table, assuming there is a column `salary`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

This will return the top 3 employees with the highest salaries, ordered from highest to lowest salary.

### Example 3: Using `LIMIT` with `OFFSET` for Pagination

The `LIMIT` clause can also be combined with an **`OFFSET`** to skip a specified number of rows before starting to return the result set. This is often used for **pagination**, where you want to retrieve a specific "page" of data, such as the second page of results.

### Syntax for `LIMIT` with `OFFSET`:

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table
LIMIT number_of_rows OFFSET skip_rows;
```

- **`number_of_rows`**: The number of rows to return.
- **`skip_rows`**: The number of rows to skip before returning the result.

### Example 4: Using `LIMIT` with `OFFSET` for Pagination

Suppose you want to display records in pages, with each page showing 10 employees, and you want to retrieve the second page of results:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;
```

This query will skip the first 10 rows (effectively showing page 2) and return the next 10 rows. If you wanted the third page, you would adjust the `OFFSET` to 20:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
```

---

### Example 5: Using `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY` and `OFFSET`

You can also combine `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, and `OFFSET` to paginate results while ensuring that the data is ordered. For example, to get the second page of the highest-paid employees:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;
```

This will return the second page of employees ordered by salary in descending order, with each page showing 10 employees.

---

### Example 6: Using `LIMIT` with a Single Row Query

In some cases, you might just want to get a single row (such as the first or last row). For example, to retrieve only the first employee based on their `id`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY id ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

This query will return the employee with the lowest `id` in the table. If you wanted the last employee, you could reverse the order:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY id DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

This will return the employee with the highest `id` in the table.

### Summary of `LIMIT` Usage

- **`LIMIT`**: Restricts the number of rows returned by the query.
  - **Example**: `LIMIT 5` will return only 5 rows.
- **`LIMIT` with `OFFSET`**: Used for pagination, where you specify the number of rows to skip and the number of rows to return.
  - **Example**: `LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10` will return rows 11 to 20.
- **`ORDER BY` with `LIMIT`**: Can be used to sort the data and then limit the number of rows returned.
  - **Example**: `ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 3` will return the top 3 employees based on salary.

The `LIMIT` clause is essential when working with large datasets, as it allows you to limit the result set to just the rows you need, improving performance and making the data easier to handle.
