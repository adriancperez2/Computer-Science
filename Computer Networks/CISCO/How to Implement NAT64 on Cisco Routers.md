Implementing NAT64 (Network Address Translation 64) on Cisco routers allows IPv6-only hosts to communicate with IPv4-only hosts. NAT64 translates IPv6 addresses to IPv4 addresses and vice versa. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Access the Router's CLI

Connect to your Cisco router using a console cable or through SSH/Telnet.

### Step 2: Enter Privileged Exec Mode

```shell
enable
```

Provide the enable password if prompted.

### Step 3: Enter Global Configuration Mode

```shell
configure terminal
```

### Step 4: Enable IPv6 Unicast Routing

```shell
ipv6 unicast-routing
```

This command enables IPv6 routing on the router.

### Step 5: Configure the NAT64 Prefix

```shell
ipv6 nat64 prefix <prefix> <length> <inside-vrf>
```

Replace `<prefix>` with the IPv6 prefix, `<length>` with the prefix length, and `<inside-vrf>` with the VRF name if you're using one.

Example:

```shell
ipv6 nat64 prefix 2001:DB8::/32 96 inside
```

### Step 6: Configure DNS64

```shell
ipv6 nat64 dns64 <dns-server>
```

Replace `<dns-server>` with the IPv6 address of your DNS server.

Example:

```shell
ipv6 nat64 dns64 2001:DB8::1
```

### Step 7: Configure an Access Control List (ACL)

```shell
ipv6 access-list <acl-name>
permit ipv6 <source-prefix> <source-prefix-length> <destination-prefix> <destination-prefix-length>
```

Replace `<acl-name>` with the name of the ACL, `<source-prefix>` with the source IPv6 prefix, `<source-prefix-length>` with the prefix length, `<destination-prefix>` with the destination IPv6 prefix, and `<destination-prefix-length>` with the prefix length.

Example:

```shell
ipv6 access-list NAT64_ACL
permit ipv6 2001:DB8::/32 any
```

### Step 8: Create a NAT64 Pool

```shell
ipv6 nat64 v6v4 pool <pool-name> <start-ipv6> <end-ipv6>
```

Replace `<pool-name>` with the name of the NAT64 pool, `<start-ipv6>` with the starting IPv6 address, and `<end-ipv6>` with the ending IPv6 address.

Example:

```shell
ipv6 nat64 v6v4 pool NAT64_POOL 2001:DB8::1 2001:DB8::FF
```

### Step 9: Configure NAT64 Inside Source

```shell
ipv6 nat64 source v6v4 <acl-name> pool <pool-name>
```

Replace `<acl-name>` with the name of the ACL created earlier, and `<pool-name>` with the name of the NAT64 pool.

Example:

```shell
ipv6 nat64 source v6v4 NAT64_ACL pool NAT64_POOL
```

### Step 10: Apply NAT64 to an Interface

```shell
interface <interface-type> <interface-number>
ipv6 nat64 outside
```

Replace `<interface-type> <interface-number>` with the specific interface.

Example:

```shell
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
ipv6 nat64 outside
```

### Step 11: Save Configuration

```shell
write memory
```

or

```shell
copy running-config startup-config
```

### Important Notes:

- Ensure that your router supports NAT64 and that it's running a compatible IOS version.

- Make sure that the IPv6 prefixes, DNS64 address, and NAT64 pool ranges are correctly specified.

- Always consult the documentation for your specific router model and IOS version if you encounter any issues. The exact commands and syntax might vary depending on the specific Cisco router model and IOS version you are using.
