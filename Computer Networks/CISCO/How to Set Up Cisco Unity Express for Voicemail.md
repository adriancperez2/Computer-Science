Setting up Cisco Unity Express (CUE) for voicemail involves configuring the voicemail system on the CUE module or integrated service module (ISM) in a Cisco router. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Access CUE Module

1. Connect to the router that contains the CUE module via SSH or console cable.

2. Access the CUE module by entering privileged exec mode and then entering the CUE module CLI:

```shell
enable
service-module service-engine <slot>/<module> session
```

Replace `<slot>/<module>` with the appropriate slot and module numbers where the CUE is installed.

### Step 2: Initial Setup

When accessing the CUE module for the first time, you'll be prompted to perform initial setup tasks. Follow the on-screen prompts to configure:

- **Hostname**: Assign a hostname for the CUE module.
- **IP Address**: Set the IP address and subnet mask.
- **Gateway**: Specify the default gateway.
- **DNS**: Configure DNS settings if needed.
- **Time Zone**: Set the time zone for proper timekeeping.

### Step 3: Create Mailboxes

1. Access the CUE module's CLI and enter configuration mode:

```shell
configure terminal
```

2. Create mailboxes for users. Use the following command for each user:

```shell
username <username> create
```

Replace `<username>` with the actual username.

### Step 4: Assign Extensions

Assign extensions to the created mailboxes:

```shell
username <username> extension <extension>
```

Replace `<username>` with the username and `<extension>` with the extension number.

### Step 5: Set Greetings and PINs

Users can set up their own greetings and PINs by accessing the voicemail system from their phones. They'll follow the voice prompts to customize their greetings and set up their personal identification numbers (PINs).

### Step 6: Configure Call Forwarding

Users can configure call forwarding settings from their phones or through the voicemail system.

### Step 7: Access Voicemail from Phones

Users can access their voicemail by dialing the voicemail access number (usually a pilot number assigned to CUE) from their phones.

### Step 8: Access Voicemail Remotely (Optional)

If users need to access their voicemail remotely, you'll need to set up an external access number and configure the appropriate call routing on your router.

### Step 9: Configure Voicemail Features (Optional)

Explore additional features like email notifications, message waiting indicators, and custom greetings based on specific business requirements.

### Step 10: Test Voicemail Functionality

Perform tests to ensure that users can successfully receive and retrieve voicemail messages.

### Step 11: Monitor and Troubleshoot

Regularly monitor voicemail usage and address any issues or user requests promptly.

### Important Notes:

- Be sure to consult the specific documentation for your Cisco router model and the version of Cisco Unity Express you are using. The CLI commands and procedures may vary slightly depending on the specific hardware and software versions.

- Ensure that users are provided with instructions on how to access and configure their voicemail boxes.

- Test voicemail functionality thoroughly to confirm that it meets the organization's requirements.
