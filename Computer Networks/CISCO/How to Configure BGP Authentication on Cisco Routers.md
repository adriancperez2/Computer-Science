Implementing BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) route aggregation on Cisco routers helps reduce the size of the routing table by summarizing multiple routes into a single aggregate route. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Access the Router's CLI

Connect to your Cisco router using a console cable or through SSH/Telnet.

### Step 2: Enter Privileged Exec Mode

```shell
enable
```

Provide the enable password if prompted.

### Step 3: Enter Global Configuration Mode

```shell
configure terminal
```

### Step 4: Configure BGP Process

```shell
router bgp <AS-number>
```

Replace `<AS-number>` with your BGP Autonomous System number.

Example:

```shell
router bgp 65001
```

### Step 5: Configure Aggregation Address

```shell
aggregate-address <address> <mask> [summary-only]
```

Replace `<address>` with the aggregate address and `<mask>` with the subnet mask. The `summary-only` option is used to advertise only the aggregate route and suppress the more specific routes.

Example:

```shell
aggregate-address 192.168.0.0 255.255.0.0 summary-only
```

### Step 6: Save Configuration

```shell
write memory
```

or

```shell
copy running-config startup-config
```

### Important Notes:

- Route aggregation should be used judiciously to avoid loss of granularity in routing information.

- Ensure that the aggregate address includes all the more specific routes you want to summarize.

- Verify the effect of aggregation using `show ip bgp` and `show ip route`.

- Always consult the documentation for your specific router model and IOS version if you encounter any issues. The exact commands and syntax might vary depending on the specific Cisco router model and IOS version you are using.
