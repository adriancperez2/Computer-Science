Generating and analyzing packet captures on Cisco devices involves using tools like Embedded Packet Capture (EPC) and Wireshark for in-depth analysis. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Generating a Packet Capture using Embedded Packet Capture (EPC):

### Step 1: Access the Router's CLI

Connect to your Cisco router using a console cable or through SSH/Telnet.

### Step 2: Enter Privileged Exec Mode

```shell
enable
```

Provide the enable password if prompted.

### Step 3: Enter Global Configuration Mode

```shell
configure terminal
```

### Step 4: Define an Access List for Packet Capture

```shell
access-list <access-list-number> permit <source-IP> <destination-IP> <protocol>
```

Replace `<access-list-number>` with a unique number, `<source-IP>` and `<destination-IP>` with the desired source and destination IP addresses, and `<protocol>` with the desired protocol (e.g., `ip`, `tcp`, `udp`, etc.).

Example:

```shell
access-list 100 permit ip any host 192.168.1.1
```

### Step 5: Define a Capture Buffer

```shell
monitor capture buffer <buffer-name> size <buffer-size> max-size <max-size> circular
```

Replace `<buffer-name>` with a name for the buffer, `<buffer-size>` with the size in bytes, and `<max-size>` with the maximum size in bytes.

Example:

```shell
monitor capture buffer CAPTURE_BUFFER size 1024 max-size 4096 circular
```

### Step 6: Define a Capture Point

```shell
monitor capture point ip cef <point-name> gigabitethernet <interface> both
```

Replace `<point-name>` with a name for the capture point and `<interface>` with the specific interface you want to capture on.

Example:

```shell
monitor capture point ip cef CAPTURE_POINT gigabitethernet 0/0 both
```

### Step 7: Associate the Access List and Capture Buffer with the Capture Point

```shell
monitor capture point associate <point-name> <access-list-number> <buffer-name>
```

Replace `<point-name>` with the name of the capture point, `<access-list-number>` with the access list number, and `<buffer-name>` with the buffer name.

Example:

```shell
monitor capture point associate CAPTURE_POINT 100 CAPTURE_BUFFER
```

### Step 8: Start the Packet Capture

```shell
monitor capture point start <point-name>
```

Replace `<point-name>` with the name of the capture point.

Example:

```shell
monitor capture point start CAPTURE_POINT
```

### Step 9: Generate Traffic for Capturing

Generate the desired traffic that you want to capture on the specified interface.

### Step 10: Stop the Packet Capture

```shell
monitor capture point stop <point-name>
```

Replace `<point-name>` with the name of the capture point.

Example:

```shell
monitor capture point stop CAPTURE_POINT
```

### Analyzing the Packet Capture:

### Step 1: Download the Capture File

Retrieve the capture file from the router, either using TFTP or by copying it to a USB drive if supported.

```shell
copy <capture-file> tftp://<TFTP-server-IP>/<destination-folder>/<destination-file>
```

Replace `<capture-file>` with the file name, `<TFTP-server-IP>` with the IP address of the TFTP server, `<destination-folder>` with the folder on the server, and `<destination-file>` with the desired name of the file.

### Step 2: Open the Capture File in Wireshark

Use Wireshark or any other packet analysis tool to open and analyze the capture file.

### Important Notes:

- EPC may not be supported on all Cisco devices. Refer to the documentation for your specific router model and IOS version.

- Be cautious when capturing and analyzing packets in production environments, as it can impact network performance.

- Ensure that you have proper authorization and follow security protocols when conducting packet captures.

- Always consult the documentation for your specific router model and IOS version if you encounter any issues. The exact commands and syntax might vary depending on the specific Cisco router model and IOS version you are using.
