Implementing IPv6 access control lists (ACLs) on Cisco routers allows you to filter IPv6 traffic based on specified criteria. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Access the Router's CLI

Connect to your Cisco router using a console cable or through SSH/Telnet.

### Step 2: Enter Privileged Exec Mode

```shell
enable
```

Provide the enable password if prompted.

### Step 3: Enter Global Configuration Mode

```shell
configure terminal
```

### Step 4: Create an IPv6 ACL

```shell
ipv6 access-list <acl-name> [sequence-number]
```

Replace `<acl-name>` with the desired name of the IPv6 ACL and optionally specify a `<sequence-number>` if you want to insert an entry at a specific position.

Example:

```shell
ipv6 access-list MY_ACL
```

### Step 5: Define Permit or Deny Statements

```shell
permit|deny <protocol> <source-address> <source-wildcard> <destination-address> <destination-wildcard>
```

Replace `<protocol>` with the desired protocol (e.g., `tcp`, `udp`, `icmp`, `ipv6`), `<source-address>` and `<destination-address>` with the source and destination IPv6 addresses, and `<source-wildcard>` and `<destination-wildcard>` with the corresponding wildcard masks.

Example (permit ICMP traffic from any source to any destination):

```shell
permit icmp any any
```

### Step 6: Apply the ACL to an Interface

```shell
interface <interface-type> <interface-number>
ipv6 traffic-filter <acl-name> {in|out}
```

Replace `<interface-type> <interface-number>` with the specific interface and `<acl-name>` with the name of the IPv6 ACL. Choose whether to apply the ACL to inbound (`in`) or outbound (`out`) traffic.

Example (applying the ACL to the inbound direction on GigabitEthernet0/0):

```shell
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
ipv6 traffic-filter MY_ACL in
```

### Step 7: Save Configuration

```shell
write memory
```

or

```shell
copy running-config startup-config
```

### Important Notes:

- Ensure that your router supports IPv6 and that it's running a compatible IOS version.

- ACL entries are processed in order. Make sure to place more specific entries before less specific ones.

- Be careful when applying ACLs, as they can impact traffic flows.

- Always consult the documentation for your specific router model and IOS version if you encounter any issues. The exact commands and syntax might vary depending on the specific Cisco router model and IOS version you are using.
