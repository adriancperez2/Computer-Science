Configuring Cisco CallManager (now known as Cisco Unified Communications Manager or CUCM) for IP Telephony involves several steps to set up and manage the telephony environment. Here's a general guide:

### Step 1: Access Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM)

1. Connect to the CUCM administration interface using a web browser.

2. Log in with the appropriate credentials (username and password).

### Step 2: Configure System Settings

1. Navigate to **System > Enterprise Parameters** and set up parameters like the domain name, IP addresses, and other system-wide settings.

2. Verify and configure **Date/Time Group** and **NTP Servers** to ensure accurate time synchronization.

### Step 3: Add Phones and Gateways

1. **Phones**:
   - Navigate to **Device > Phone** and add or import phones. Assign them to users or specific departments.

2. **Gateways**:
   - Navigate to **Device > Gateway** and configure gateways for connectivity to the PSTN or other networks.

### Step 4: Set Up Dial Plans

1. Define **Partitions** and **Calling Search Spaces** under **Call Routing > Class of Control**. These control the calling and called numbers that a device can access.

2. Configure **Route Patterns** and **Route Lists** to define how calls are routed through the network.

### Step 5: Create Users and Assign Phones

1. Navigate to **User Management > End User** and add users. Associate each user with a phone.

2. Assign **Directory Numbers (DNs)** to users, which represent their phone numbers.

### Step 6: Configure Voicemail

1. Set up a voicemail system (Cisco Unity Connection or other voicemail platforms) and integrate it with CUCM.

2. Configure voicemail pilot numbers and user mailboxes.

### Step 7: Set Up Voice Messaging Profiles

Create **Voice Messaging Profiles** to control how voice messages are handled:

- Define settings like message notification, MWI (Message Waiting Indicator), and message aging policy.

### Step 8: Configure Media Resources

Set up resources like Music on Hold (MOH) and conference bridges under **Device > Media Resources**.

### Step 9: Enable Mobility Features (Optional)

If required, configure mobility features like Mobile Connect or Extension Mobility under **Device > Device Settings > Device Defaults**.

### Step 10: Implement Security Measures

1. Set up security measures such as user authentication, access control, and encryption.

2. Configure **Security Certificates** under **System > Security > Certificate Management**.

### Step 11: Set Up Call Admission Control (Optional)

Configure Call Admission Control (CAC) under **System > Service Parameters** to manage call bandwidth.

### Step 12: Apply Changes and Monitor

1. Apply the changes and configurations by restarting the necessary services or devices.

2. Regularly monitor the system for performance, security, and any anomalies.

### Step 13: Perform Regular Backups

Regularly back up the CUCM configuration and database to ensure data integrity and easy recovery in case of any issues.

### Important Notes:

- Cisco Unified Communications Manager is a complex system, and this is a general guide. Be sure to consult the specific documentation for your version and model of CUCM for detailed instructions and best practices.

- Before making changes, especially in a production environment, ensure you have a maintenance window and proper change management procedures in place.

- Testing and verification are crucial after any configuration changes to ensure they meet the requirements and do not adversely affect operations.
