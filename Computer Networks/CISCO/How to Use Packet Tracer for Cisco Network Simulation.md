Packet Tracer is a powerful network simulation tool developed by Cisco. It allows users to create virtual networks, design and configure routers and switches, and practice troubleshooting skills in a safe environment. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use Packet Tracer for Cisco network simulation:

1. **Download and Install Packet Tracer**:
   - You can download Packet Tracer from the Cisco Networking Academy website if you have a valid account. As of my last update in September 2021, it might be available for free to students enrolled in Cisco courses.
   - Install the software following the on-screen instructions.

2. **Launch Packet Tracer**:
   - Open the application after installation.

3. **Create a New Network**:
   - Click on "File" > "New" to start a new project.

4. **Select Devices**:
   - On the left-hand side, you'll find a panel with various networking devices like routers, switches, PCs, etc.
   - Drag and drop the devices you need onto the workspace.

5. **Connect Devices**:
   - Use the "Connections" tool (looks like a lightning bolt) to connect devices. Click on a device, and then click on another to create a connection.

6. **Configure Devices**:
   - Double-click on a device to open the configuration window.
   - For routers and switches, you can configure interfaces, set IP addresses, create VLANs, etc.
   - For PCs, you can set IP addresses, gateway, DNS, etc.

7. **Power On Devices**:
   - Click on a device and use the power button to turn it on.

8. **Use the Command Line Interface (CLI)**:
   - For routers and switches, you can access the CLI by clicking on the device and selecting the "CLI" tab.
   - Here, you can use the command-line interface to configure the device.

9. **Add Services and Applications**:
   - You can add services like HTTP servers, DHCP servers, etc., to devices.
   - This can be done through the "Services" tab in device properties.

10. **Simulation Mode**:
    - Click on the "Realtime" button at the bottom to enter simulation mode.
    - Here, you can send packets, troubleshoot network issues, and observe how the network behaves.

11. **Packet Capture**:
    - In simulation mode, you can also use the packet tracer tool to capture and analyze network traffic.

12. **Save Your Project**:
    - Periodically save your work by clicking on "File" > "Save As".

13. **Assessment and Validation**:
    - Use Packet Tracer for testing different network configurations, troubleshooting problems, and assessing the performance of your virtual network.

14. **Additional Resources**:
    - Cisco provides a range of tutorials and guides on using Packet Tracer. You can also find community forums and discussion groups where you can ask questions and learn from others.

Remember, Packet Tracer is a simulation tool, so while it's a great way to learn and practice networking concepts, it doesn't replicate every aspect of a real-world network. For more complex scenarios, you might eventually want to work with physical hardware or use more advanced virtualization platforms.
