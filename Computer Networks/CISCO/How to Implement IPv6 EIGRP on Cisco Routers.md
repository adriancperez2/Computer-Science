Implementing IPv6 EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) on Cisco routers involves enabling EIGRP for IPv6 and configuring EIGRP parameters. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Access the Router's CLI

Connect to your Cisco router using a console cable or through SSH/Telnet.

### Step 2: Enter Privileged Exec Mode

```shell
enable
```

Provide the enable password if prompted.

### Step 3: Enter Global Configuration Mode

```shell
configure terminal
```

### Step 4: Enable IPv6 Unicast Routing

```shell
ipv6 unicast-routing
```

This command enables IPv6 routing on the router.

### Step 5: Configure EIGRP for IPv6

```shell
router eigrp <AS-number>
```

Replace `<AS-number>` with the desired EIGRP Autonomous System number.

Example:

```shell
router eigrp 100
```

### Step 6: Enable EIGRP on an Interface

```shell
interface <interface-type> <interface-number>
ipv6 eigrp <AS-number>
```

Replace `<interface-type> <interface-number>` with the specific interface and `<AS-number>` with the EIGRP AS number.

Example:

```shell
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
ipv6 eigrp 100
```

### Step 7: Exit EIGRP Configuration

```shell
exit
```

### Step 8: Verify EIGRP Configuration

```shell
show ipv6 eigrp neighbors
show ipv6 eigrp interfaces
```

These commands will display EIGRP neighbor information and interface status.

### Step 9: Save Configuration

```shell
write memory
```

or

```shell
copy running-config startup-config
```

### Important Notes:

- Ensure that your router supports EIGRP for IPv6 and that it's running a compatible IOS version.

- EIGRP AS numbers should be consistent across routers in the same EIGRP network.

- Verify that EIGRP for IPv6 is enabled on all interfaces that participate in EIGRP routing.

- Always consult the documentation for your specific router model and IOS version if you encounter any issues. The exact commands and syntax might vary depending on the specific Cisco router model and IOS version you are using.
