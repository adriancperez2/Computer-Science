Since forever ago, I've wanted to try writing assembly, even if just to understand why the [Rollercoaster Tycoon creator would write 99% of the game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_(video_game)#:~:text=Sawyer%20wrote%2099%25%20of%20the,%2C%20rendering%2C%20and%20paint%20programs.) in it. To be fair, even after all of this, I still don't understand why they did that.

Embarking on this quest, I quickly found a lot of scattered and difficult to understand resources. It took compiling a bunch of different materials together to come to a high level understanding of what's happening in my computer.

I wanted to write down my learnings for those who are new to this part of their computer (like me!), including [working code examples](/code). This is by no means an exhaustive guide, but instead serves as an approachable introduction to assembly.

Going through this guide takes as little as **30 minutes**, but you can also spend a few hours going through it if you want to delve into the code examples.

Enjoy!
