> Electronics is the branch of physics and engineering that deals with the study and application of devices, circuits, and systems that use electrical energy to perform useful tasks. In basic electronics, we primarily focus on components and systems that process electrical signals, allowing for applications like communication, computing, lighting, and power systems. Understanding basic electronics is essential for anyone interested in fields such as electrical engineering, robotics, and even DIY projects like building gadgets or repairing appliances.
