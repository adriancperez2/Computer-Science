### **Functional Units of the 8086 Microprocessor**

The **Intel 8086** microprocessor is divided into two main functional units: the **Bus Interface Unit (BIU)** and the **Execution Unit (EU)**. Each of these units handles specific tasks that together enable the processor to function efficiently. Below is a detailed explanation of the different functional units of the **8086** microprocessor:

### **1. Bus Interface Unit (BIU):**

The **Bus Interface Unit (BIU)** is responsible for interfacing the microprocessor with memory and I/O devices. It manages all the tasks associated with fetching instructions and data from memory, managing address generation, and coordinating the movement of data between the microprocessor and memory.

**Key functions of the BIU:**
- **Instruction Fetching:** The BIU is responsible for fetching instructions from the memory, which is stored in the **instruction queue**. It retrieves the instruction from memory in advance, ensuring that the **Execution Unit (EU)** can execute the instruction as soon as it is ready. This process is referred to as **pipelining**, which enhances the speed of instruction execution.
- **Address Generation:** The BIU generates the physical memory address used to fetch data or instructions. It combines the **segment address** (from the segment registers) with the **offset address** (from the **instruction pointer** or **data registers**) to form a **20-bit physical address**, allowing access to memory locations in the 1MB address space.
- **Data Fetch/Write:** The BIU manages data movement to/from memory and I/O ports. It performs the tasks of writing data to memory or reading data from memory based on the type of instruction.

**Main Components of the BIU:**
- **Instruction Queue:** The 8086 uses a **6-byte instruction queue** that stores instructions fetched from memory in advance. This allows the 8086 to fetch the next instruction while the **Execution Unit (EU)** is executing the current one. This improves the throughput of instruction execution.
- **Segment Registers:** The BIU uses four **segment registers** to generate addresses for different memory segments:
  - **CS (Code Segment Register):** Stores the base address of the code segment.
  - **DS (Data Segment Register):** Stores the base address of the data segment.
  - **SS (Stack Segment Register):** Stores the base address of the stack segment.
  - **ES (Extra Segment Register):** Used for extra data storage, especially in string operations.
- **Address Bus:** The BIU includes a 20-bit address bus (A0-A19) that is used to address memory locations.
- **Data Bus:** The BIU uses a 16-bit data bus (D0-D15) to transfer data between the microprocessor and memory or I/O ports.

### **2. Execution Unit (EU):**

The **Execution Unit (EU)** is responsible for executing the instructions fetched by the **Bus Interface Unit (BIU)**. It decodes the instructions and carries out the necessary operations using the **Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)**, the **registers**, and the **flags**. The EU performs arithmetic, logical, and data manipulation operations based on the instructions.

**Key functions of the EU:**
- **Instruction Decoding:** The EU decodes the instructions fetched by the BIU from the instruction queue and determines what action needs to be performed.
- **Execution of Instructions:** After decoding, the EU executes the instructions. The execution may involve arithmetic operations (like addition and subtraction), logical operations (like AND, OR, NOT), or data transfer operations (like moving data between registers).
- **ALU Operations:** The **Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)** inside the EU performs arithmetic and logical operations, such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, etc.
- **Flags Management:** The EU manipulates and updates the **flags register** based on the result of the operation. The flags include:
  - **Carry Flag (CF)**
  - **Zero Flag (ZF)**
  - **Sign Flag (SF)**
  - **Parity Flag (PF)**
  - **Auxiliary Carry Flag (AC)**
  - **Overflow Flag (OF)**
  - These flags provide status information about the result of the last operation, such as whether the result was zero or there was a carry from an arithmetic operation.
  
**Main Components of the EU:**
- **General-Purpose Registers:** The EU uses **16-bit registers** to perform operations. These registers are:
  - **AX, BX, CX, DX (Accumulator, Base, Count, Data registers):** Used for data manipulation and arithmetic operations.
  - **SP (Stack Pointer):** Points to the current stack location.
  - **BP (Base Pointer):** Used for referencing stack data.
  - **SI (Source Index) and DI (Destination Index):** Used for string operations and addressing in memory.
  
- **ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit):** The ALU is the heart of the execution unit and performs all the arithmetic and logical operations.

- **Flags Register:** The flags register stores status flags that reflect the results of operations. It is updated after every operation performed by the ALU.

### **Relationship Between the BIU and EU:**

- **Pipelining:** One of the main advantages of the 8086 microprocessor is the use of pipelining. The BIU and EU work in parallel, allowing the processor to fetch the next instruction while executing the current one. This improves the performance and efficiency of the processor.
  
- **Instruction Queue:** The BIU fetches instructions and stores them in the instruction queue, while the EU processes and executes them. If the EU is ready to process an instruction and the queue is not empty, it can immediately fetch the next instruction from the queue. This minimizes idle time and ensures the processor is constantly working.

- **Data Movement and Execution:** The BIU handles the data transfer between memory, I/O ports, and the registers, while the EU focuses on performing calculations and logical operations. Both units are essential for the efficient operation of the 8086.

### **Summary of the Functional Units:**

| **Functional Unit** | **Primary Responsibilities** |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Bus Interface Unit (BIU)** | Fetches instructions, generates memory addresses, manages data transfer between memory/I/O and processor. |
| **Execution Unit (EU)** | Decodes and executes instructions, performs arithmetic and logical operations, and manages flags. |

- The **BIU** manages the fetching and storing of instructions and data, while the **EU** performs the actual processing and computation.
- Both units work together in parallel to ensure the processor performs tasks efficiently and quickly.
- The **8086** microprocessorâ€™s ability to pipeline instructions via the instruction queue and the division of labor between the **BIU** and **EU** significantly boosts performance.

This structure made the **8086** microprocessor powerful for its time and laid the foundation for future **x86 architecture** processors.
