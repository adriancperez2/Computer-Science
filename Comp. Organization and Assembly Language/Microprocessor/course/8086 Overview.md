### **8086 Microprocessor Overview**

The **Intel 8086** is a **16-bit microprocessor** introduced by **Intel** in **1978**. It is a significant advancement over the **8085 microprocessor**, with improvements in processing power, addressing capability, and architecture. The 8086 became a foundation for the development of more advanced processors like the 80286, 80386, and so on, eventually leading to the x86 architecture, which is still widely used in personal computers today.

### **Key Features of 8086:**

1. **Word Size:**
   - **16-bit** word size. The 8086 can process **16 bits** of data at a time, which is a significant increase compared to the 8085, which was an **8-bit** processor.

2. **Data Bus:**
   - It has a **16-bit data bus**, meaning it can transfer **16 bits** of data in a single operation, enabling faster data throughput than 8-bit processors like the 8085.

3. **Address Bus:**
   - The 8086 has a **20-bit address bus**, which allows it to address up to **1 MB (2^20 bytes)** of memory. This is a significant improvement over the 8085, which could address only up to 64 KB of memory.

4. **Instruction Set:**
   - The 8086 has a rich and versatile instruction set, supporting **arithmetic, logical, data transfer**, and **branch instructions**. It also includes **control instructions** and **string manipulation** operations.

5. **Segmented Memory:**
   - The 8086 uses a **segmented memory model**, which allows it to overcome the **1 MB memory limitation** by dividing memory into **segments**. These segments can be **data**, **code**, or **stack** segments, which are then addressed by a combination of **segment registers** and **offset addresses**.

6. **Registers:**
   - The 8086 has a set of **16-bit registers**, including **general-purpose registers**, **index registers**, **segment registers**, and a **flag register**.

7. **Clock Speed:**
   - The 8086 operates at **5 MHz to 10 MHz**, and the speed depends on the specific model of the processor.

### **8086 Microprocessor Architecture:**

The architecture of the 8086 microprocessor is based on a **complex instruction set computer (CISC)** architecture. It has a **pipelines** structure that allows it to execute more than one instruction at a time.

#### **Main Components:**

1. **ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit):**
   - The **ALU** performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and logical operations like AND, OR, NOT, etc.

2. **Registers:**
   - The 8086 has **14 registers**, which can be divided into the following categories:
     - **General-purpose registers** (AX, BX, CX, DX)
     - **Pointer and index registers** (SP, BP, SI, DI)
     - **Segment registers** (CS, DS, SS, ES)
     - **Flag register** (used to store the status flags like zero, carry, sign, etc.)
  
3. **Bus Interface Unit (BIU):**
   - The **BIU** is responsible for fetching instructions from memory, decoding them, and placing them into the **instruction queue**. It handles the **address generation** and **data transfer** between memory and the processor.

4. **Execution Unit (EU):**
   - The **EU** performs the execution of instructions. It interacts with the **ALU** and the registers to perform the specified operations (arithmetic, logical, data transfer, etc.).

### **8086 Pin Configuration:**

The **8086 microprocessor** has **40 pins**, which are used for power supply, control signals, data and address bus, and interrupt requests. Some important pins include:

1. **Vcc (Pin 40):** Supply voltage (5V).
2. **GND (Pin 20):** Ground.
3. **Address Bus (A0-A19):** 20 address lines used to address up to 1 MB of memory.
4. **Data Bus (D0-D15):** 16 data lines used to transfer data.
5. **ALE (Pin 25):** Address Latch Enable signal; indicates when the address is valid.
6. **M/IO (Pin 28):** Memory or I/O read/write control.
7. **RD (Pin 32):** Read signal, used to indicate a memory or I/O read operation.
8. **WR (Pin 33):** Write signal, used to indicate a memory or I/O write operation.
9. **INTA (Pin 36):** Interrupt Acknowledge, used during interrupt processing.
10. **CLK (Pin 19):** Clock signal input, typically operates at a frequency of 5 MHz to 10 MHz.
11. **RESET (Pin 36):** A signal used to reset the microprocessor.

### **8086 Memory Segmentation:**

One of the main features of the 8086 is its **segmented memory architecture**, which enables it to access more memory than its **16-bit** data bus could normally handle (a 16-bit processor can directly address only 64 KB of memory). The **8086** overcomes this limitation by splitting memory into **segments**:

1. **Code Segment (CS):** Contains the executable program code.
2. **Data Segment (DS):** Contains the program's data.
3. **Stack Segment (SS):** Used for storing temporary data and return addresses.
4. **Extra Segment (ES):** Used for additional data storage or external memory.

A **20-bit address** is generated by combining a **16-bit segment address** (stored in the segment registers) with a **16-bit offset** to access the entire 1 MB memory space.

### **8086 Addressing Modes:**

The 8086 provides several addressing modes for accessing operands in memory. Some common addressing modes include:

1. **Immediate Addressing Mode:**
   - Operand is directly provided in the instruction.
   - Example: `MOV AX, 32H` (Move immediate data `32H` to AX).

2. **Register Addressing Mode:**
   - Operand is in a register.
   - Example: `MOV AX, BX` (Move contents of BX into AX).

3. **Direct Addressing Mode:**
   - Operand is located in memory, and its address is directly provided.
   - Example: `MOV AX, [2000H]` (Move contents of memory location 2000H into AX).

4. **Indirect Addressing Mode:**
   - Operand is addressed indirectly using registers.
   - Example: `MOV AX, [BX]` (Move contents of memory location addressed by BX into AX).

5. **Indexed Addressing Mode:**
   - The operand's address is obtained by adding an offset to a register.
   - Example: `MOV AX, [BX+SI]` (Move contents of memory addressed by the sum of BX and SI into AX).

### **8086 Interrupt System:**

The 8086 supports a **priority interrupt system** and has the following features:

1. **Interrupt Request (INTR):**
   - A general-purpose, maskable interrupt that can be enabled or disabled by software.
   
2. **Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI):**
   - A high-priority interrupt that cannot be disabled by software.
   
3. **Interrupt Acknowledge (INTA):**
   - The 8086 sends an acknowledge signal when it recognizes an interrupt.

4. **Interrupt Vector Table:**
   - The interrupt vector table, stored in the first 1 KB of memory, contains addresses of interrupt service routines (ISR) for various interrupt types.

### **Advantages of 8086:**

1. **Increased Memory Addressing:** 8086 can address up to 1 MB of memory.
2. **16-bit Operation:** It processes 16-bit data, making it faster and more efficient than 8-bit processors.
