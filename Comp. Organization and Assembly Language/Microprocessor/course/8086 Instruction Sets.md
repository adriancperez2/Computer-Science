- **DIV**: Divides the contents of **DX:AX** by a specified operand (unsigned division).
  - Example: `DIV BX` (Divides **DX:AX** by **BX**, stores the quotient in **AX** and remainder in **DX**).
- **IDIV**: Divides the contents of **DX:AX** by a specified operand (signed division).
  - Example: `IDIV BX` (Signed division of **DX:AX** by **BX**).
- **INC**: Increments a register or memory location by 1.
  - Example: `INC AX` (Increments **AX** by 1).
- **DEC**: Decrements a register or memory location by 1.
  - Example: `DEC BX` (Decrements **BX** by 1).

### **3. Logical Instructions**
These instructions perform logical operations such as AND, OR, XOR, etc.

- **AND**: Performs bitwise AND operation on two operands.
  - Example: `AND AX, BX` (Performs a bitwise AND of **AX** and **BX** and stores the result in **AX**).
- **OR**: Performs bitwise OR operation on two operands.
  - Example: `OR AX, BX` (Performs a bitwise OR of **AX** and **BX** and stores the result in **AX**).
- **XOR**: Performs bitwise XOR operation on two operands.
  - Example: `XOR AX, BX` (Performs a bitwise XOR of **AX** and **BX** and stores the result in **AX**).
- **NOT**: Performs a bitwise NOT operation on an operand (inverts all bits).
  - Example: `NOT AX` (Inverts all bits in **AX**).
- **TEST**: Performs a bitwise AND operation between two operands but does not store the result. It only affects the flags.
  - Example: `TEST AX, BX` (Performs AND between **AX** and **BX** and updates the flags).

### **4. Control Flow Instructions**
These instructions control the execution flow of the program.

- **JMP**: Unconditional jump to a specified address.
  - Example: `JMP 1000h` (Unconditionally jumps to the address 1000h).
- **CALL**: Calls a procedure (subroutine).
  - Example: `CALL 2000h` (Calls the procedure located at address 2000h).
- **RET**: Returns from a procedure.
  - Example: `RET` (Returns from the current procedure).
- **JZ**: Jumps if the Zero Flag (ZF) is set.
  - Example: `JZ 3000h` (Jumps to 3000h if the Zero Flag is set).
- **JNZ**: Jumps if the Zero Flag (ZF) is not set.
  - Example: `JNZ 4000h` (Jumps to 4000h if the Zero Flag is not set).
- **JC**: Jumps if the Carry Flag (CF) is set.
  - Example: `JC 5000h` (Jumps to 5000h if the Carry Flag is set).
- **JNC**: Jumps if the Carry Flag (CF) is not set.
  - Example: `JNC 6000h` (Jumps to 6000h if the Carry Flag is not set).
- **JAE**: Jumps if the Carry Flag (CF) or Zero Flag (ZF) is set (jump if above or equal).
  - Example: `JAE 7000h` (Jumps to 7000h if **AX** â‰¥ **BX**).

### **5. String Instructions**
These instructions perform operations on strings, which are sequences of bytes or words in memory.

- **MOVSB**: Moves a byte from the source to the destination.
  - Example: `MOVSB` (Moves a byte from the source string to the destination string).
