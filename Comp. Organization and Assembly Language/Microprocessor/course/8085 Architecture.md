The **Intel 8085** is an 8-bit microprocessor developed by Intel in the mid-1970s. It was an enhanced version of the earlier 8080 microprocessor, with improved features and a simpler, more efficient design. The 8085 was widely used in embedded systems, industrial control systems, and early personal computers. It operates at clock speeds typically ranging from 3 to 5 MHz.

### **Intel 8085 Microprocessor Architecture**

The architecture of the 8085 microprocessor consists of several key components:

#### 1. **Registers:**
   The 8085 has a total of **6 general-purpose registers** (B, C, D, E, H, L) and some additional registers for specialized purposes:
   - **Accumulator (A):** The primary register used for arithmetic and logic operations.
   - **General-purpose registers (B, C, D, E, H, L):** Used to store data temporarily for processing.
   - **Flag Register:** A set of 5 flags used to indicate the results of arithmetic and logical operations:
     - **Sign (S):** Indicates a negative result.
     - **Zero (Z):** Indicates a zero result.
     - **Auxiliary Carry (AC):** Used in BCD (binary-coded decimal) arithmetic operations.
     - **Parity (P):** Indicates even or odd parity of the result.
     - **Carry (CY):** Indicates if there is a carry out from the most significant bit during arithmetic operations.

   - **Program Counter (PC):** A 16-bit register that holds the address of the next instruction to be executed.
   - **Stack Pointer (SP):** A 16-bit register that points to the top of the stack in memory.

#### 2. **Bus Systems:**
   - **Address Bus:** The 8085 has a 16-bit address bus that can address **64 KB** of memory (from 0000H to FFFFH).
   - **Data Bus:** It has an 8-bit data bus, allowing it to transfer 8 bits of data at a time.
   - **Control Bus:** The control bus consists of several lines that manage the flow of data between the processor and memory, I/O devices, etc. These include signals like **IO/M**, **RD**, **WR**, **ALE**, etc.

#### 3. **ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit):**
   - The **ALU** performs all arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction) and logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, etc.).
   - It operates on the data in the **Accumulator** and the general-purpose registers.

#### 4. **Clock and Timing:**
   - The 8085 requires a **clock** signal to operate. The clock is provided by an external oscillator.
   - The speed of the processor is determined by the clock frequency, which is typically in the range of 3 to 5 MHz.

#### 5. **Control Unit:**
   - The **Control Unit (CU)** is responsible for decoding the instructions and generating the necessary control signals to execute the instructions.
   - The CU coordinates the operation of the ALU, registers, buses, and memory, ensuring that data is correctly fetched, processed, and stored.

#### 6. **Interrupt System:**
   - The 8085 supports **5 hardware interrupt lines** (TRAP, RST7.5, RST6.5, RST5.5, INTR), allowing it to respond to external events and switch to a different program flow.
   - **TRAP** is a non-maskable interrupt with the highest priority.

#### 7. **Serial I/O Control:**
   - The 8085 supports **serial data transmission** via its serial output data (SOD) and serial input data (SID) pins.
   - It allows for serial communication with external devices, such as modems.

#### 8. **Memory and I/O Interfacing:**
   - The 8085 can interface with **memory** (ROM/RAM) and **I/O devices** through the control signals (RD, WR, IO/M) and address/data buses.
   - It can address up to **64KB of memory** and has provisions for interfacing with external I/O devices.

### **Pin Diagram of 8085 Microprocessor:**
The 8085 has a total of **40 pins** that can be categorized as:
- **Power Supply and Ground Pins**: Vcc, Vss (Pin 40 and Pin 20)
- **Data Bus**: 8-bit data bus (Pins 1 to 8)
- **Address Bus**: 16-bit address bus (Pins 19 to 16)
- **Control Pins**: 
  - **ALE** (Pin 22): Address Latch Enable
  - **IO/M** (Pin 34): Determines whether the operation is memory or I/O
  - **RD** (Pin 32): Read control signal
  - **WR** (Pin 31): Write control signal
- **Interrupt Pins**: TRAP, RST7.5, RST6.5, RST5.5, INTR
- **Clock Pin**: CLK (Pin 37)
- **Serial I/O Pins**: SID (Pin 35), SOD (Pin 36)
- **Status Pins**: S0, S1 (Pins 27, 28) that indicate the current state of the processor.

### **Instruction Set:**
The 8085 has a rich instruction set, categorized into:
- **Data transfer instructions** (e.g., MOV, MVI)
- **Arithmetic instructions** (e.g., ADD, SUB)
- **Logical instructions** (e.g., AND, OR)
- **Branch control instructions** (e.g., JMP, CALL)
- **Control instructions** (e.g., NOP, HALT)

### **Working of the 8085 Microprocessor:**
The general operation of the 8085 microprocessor follows these steps:
1. **Fetch:** The instruction is fetched from memory using the program counter (PC).
2. **Decode:** The control unit decodes the instruction.
3. **Execute:** The ALU and other components execute the instruction based on the decoded operation.

The 8085 is capable of performing a variety of tasks such as arithmetic calculations, logic operations, data transfer, and control tasks. It is widely used in applications requiring embedded control, industrial automation, and simple computing tasks.

### **Summary of Key Features of 8085 Architecture:**
- **8-bit microprocessor**
- **16-bit address bus** (64KB memory addressing capability)
- **5 interrupt lines**
- **8-bit data bus**
- **64KB addressable memory space**
- **Multiple I/O interfacing options**
