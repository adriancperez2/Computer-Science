### **8255A Architecture**

The **8255A** consists of the following components:

1. **Data Bus Buffer**:  
   The **8255A** has an 8-bit bidirectional data bus buffer (D0-D7), which allows data to be transferred to and from the microprocessor or external peripherals.

2. **Control Logic**:  
   The control logic handles the operation of the 8255A and determines how the I/O ports are configured (input or output) based on control signals sent from the microprocessor.

3. **Ports A, B, and C**:  
   The 8255A has three 8-bit parallel I/O ports, **Port A**, **Port B**, and **Port C**:
   - **Port A** (PA0 to PA7) is typically used for high-speed data transfer.
   - **Port B** (PB0 to PB7) is used for interfacing external devices.
   - **Port C** (PC0 to PC7) is a versatile port used for I/O control lines, enabling communication with multiple external peripherals.

4. **Control Register**:  
   The control register is used to configure the working of the 8255A, allowing the microprocessor to select the mode of operation and assign the direction of data transfer (input or output) for each port.

### **Modes of Operation**

The **8255A** can operate in three different modes:

1. **Mode 0 (Basic Input/Output Mode)**:
   - In **Mode 0**, the ports (A, B, C) operate as simple **basic input/output ports**.
   - Each of the ports can be individually configured as input or output.
   - This mode is used for basic parallel communication between the **8255A** and external devices.
   
2. **Mode 1 (Strobed Input/Output Mode)**:
   - In **Mode 1**, **Port A** and **Port B** operate in a **strobed I/O mode**. This means that a **strobe pulse** is used to indicate when data is valid and ready to be read or written.
   - This mode is useful for **data transfer with synchronization** between the microprocessor and external devices.
   - **Port C** can still be used for controlling peripheral devices (like handshaking).

3. **Mode 2 (Bidirectional Data Bus Mode)**:
   - In **Mode 2**, **Port A** operates in a **bidirectional** manner, meaning it can both receive and transmit data (full-duplex communication).
   - **Port B** can be used for external peripheral control (input or output).
   - **Port C** provides control signals such as **handshaking** for communication.
   - This mode is used for **communication between devices** like **data transfer between a microprocessor and memory**.

| 4   | **D4**: Mode 1/Mode 0 (for Port B) |
| 3   | **D3**: Mode (for Port C)  |
| 2   | **D2**: Port C: Direction (input or output) |
| 1   | **D1**: Port C: Direction (input or output) |
| 0   | **D0**: Mode (for Port A and B) |

- **Mode Selection**: Bits 5, 4, and 3 define the mode of operation for Ports A, B, and C.
- **Direction Control**: Bits 2 and 1 control the direction (input/output) for **Port C**.
