### **8279 - Programmable Keyboard/Display Interface**

The **Intel 8279** is a **Programmable Keyboard/Display Interface** designed for use with microprocessors, specifically for interfacing keyboards, displays, and other input/output peripherals. It is commonly used in systems that require interaction with the user, such as terminals, computers, and industrial control systems. The 8279 simplifies the process of connecting a keyboard and display to the microprocessor and provides additional features like scanning for key presses, debouncing, and driving displays.

### **Key Features of the 8279**

1. **Keyboard Interface**:
   - It supports up to an **8x8 matrix keyboard**, allowing for the connection of up to 64 keys (key rows and columns).
   - The keyboard can be connected in a matrix form, where rows and columns are scanned to detect which key is pressed.

2. **Display Interface**:
   - The 8279 can interface with a **7-segment display** or an **LED matrix** display.
   - It can drive up to **8 digits** of a 7-segment display, or it can be configured to control a **16-character alphanumeric display**.

3. **Debouncing**:
   - The 8279 automatically handles key **debouncing**, which ensures that only a single input is registered per key press despite mechanical bouncing of the key switch.

4. **Programmability**:
   - The 8279 is programmable, allowing for configuration of the keyboard scan and display control modes.
   - It offers features like **FIFO buffer** (First In First Out) for storing keystrokes, and **interrupt generation** for notifying the microprocessor of key presses.

5. **FIFO Buffer**:
   - The 8279 includes a **FIFO buffer** for storing keystrokes before they are read by the microprocessor. This helps in preventing loss of key presses when the CPU is busy with other tasks.

6. **Interrupt Generation**:
   - The 8279 can generate an interrupt to notify the microprocessor whenever a key is pressed, saving CPU cycles by not needing constant polling of the keyboard.

7. **Flexible Display Control**:
   - It supports **multiplexed** display driving, where multiple digits can be controlled by cycling through them rapidly, creating the illusion of all digits being displayed simultaneously.

### **Functional Block Diagram of 8279**

The 8279 consists of several key blocks that enable keyboard scanning and display driving:

- **Keyboard Scanning Circuit**: Responsible for scanning the keyboard matrix and detecting key presses.
- **Display Control Circuit**: Controls the display, multiplexes digits, and drives a 7-segment or LED display.
- **FIFO Data Buffer**: Stores key codes in a FIFO buffer to be read by the CPU.
- **Control Register**: Used for programming and controlling the operation of the 8279.
- **Interrupt Logic**: Generates interrupts when keys are pressed.

### **Pin Configuration of 8279**

The 8279 is typically available in a **40-pin DIP package**, and its pin configuration is designed to interface with both the microprocessor and the external keyboard and display components.

Key pins in the 8279:

- **D0-D7**: **Data bus** pins used for communication with the microprocessor.
- **A0-A7**: Address bus pins used to select registers within the 8279.
- **R/W**: **Read/Write** signal used to control the data transfer direction (read or write).
- **CS (Chip Select)**: Activates the 8279 to select it for communication.
- **RD/WR**: Used for selecting whether the operation is a read or write operation.
- **IRQ**: **Interrupt Request** pin used to generate interrupts to the microprocessor.
- **RS1, RS0**: **Register select** pins used to select the internal registers for reading or writing.
- **CLOCK**: Provides the clock signal for timing the operations.

### **Working of 8279**

The 8279 works in two main modes: **Keyboard Mode** and **Display Mode**.

---

### **1. Keyboard Mode**

In keyboard mode, the 8279 scans a keyboard matrix and detects key presses.

- **Keyboard Scanning**: The 8279 scans the rows and columns of the keyboard matrix in a sequential manner to identify the pressed key.
  - **Rows**: The rows of the keyboard matrix are connected to output lines of the 8279.
  - **Columns**: The columns are connected to input lines of the 8279.

- **FIFO Buffer**: When a key is pressed, the corresponding key code is stored in the FIFO buffer of the 8279.
  
- **Key Debouncing**: The 8279 includes a debouncing mechanism to ensure that only a single key press is registered, even if there is mechanical bounce in the switch.

- **Interrupt Generation**: The 8279 generates an interrupt to notify the CPU whenever a key is pressed, allowing the CPU to process the input without constantly polling the keyboard.

- **Mode Control**: The keyboard scanning mode can be programmed to handle various types of keys, such as **shift keys**, **control keys**, and **function keys**.

### **2. Display Mode**

In display mode, the 8279 controls a display (typically 7-segment) and multiplexes between multiple digits.

- **Display Memory**: The 8279 holds the data for the display in memory. It can store up to **8 digits** or **16 characters** for display.
  
- **Multiplexing**: The 8279 multiplexes the display, driving one digit at a time and cycling through them rapidly to give the appearance of simultaneous display.

- **7-Segment Display Control**: If interfacing with a **7-segment display**, the 8279 drives the segments of each digit according to the data stored in its memory.

- **Alphanumeric Display**: If interfacing with an alphanumeric display, the 8279 can display characters by controlling the appropriate segments in the display.

### **Programming the 8279**

The 8279 can be programmed using a set of control registers. The CPU communicates with the 8279 via these registers to configure it for different modes and operations.

Key programming steps:

1. **Initialization**: The 8279 is initialized by writing to the control registers. This step configures the keyboard scan and display modes, and sets up the FIFO buffer.
2. **Keyboard Scanning**: After initialization, the 8279 begins scanning the keyboard and storing key codes in the FIFO buffer.
3. **Display Control**: The 8279 can be programmed to control the display by writing to its display memory.
4. **Interrupt Handling**: The 8279 can be configured to generate interrupts when a key is pressed, notifying the CPU to read the FIFO buffer.

### **Applications of 8279**

The 8279 is widely used in systems where keyboard input and display output are required. Some typical applications include:

1. **Terminals**: Used in terminals for keyboard input and display output.
2. **Industrial Control Systems**: Used for user interface systems, where the operator enters commands via a keyboard and views output on a display.
3. **Embedded Systems**: Used in embedded systems requiring keypad input and display output, such as home appliances and security systems.
4. **Point-of-Sale (POS) Systems**: Used for keypad input and numeric/alphanumeric display for transaction processing.

### **Conclusion**

The **Intel 8279** is a versatile and programmable interface device designed to handle keyboard input and display output in microprocessor systems. It simplifies the task of connecting a keyboard and a display to the microprocessor by handling tasks like scanning the keyboard matrix, debouncing keys, and controlling a multiplexed display. The 8279â€™s features like FIFO buffering, interrupt handling, and programmability make it an essential component for building user interfaces in various applications, from terminals to embedded systems.
