| **Pin No.** | **Pin Name**  | **Description**                                          |
|-------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **1 - 8**   | **PA0 - PA7** | **Port A (8-bit)**: A bidirectional data bus used for input/output. This port can be configured as input or output based on the selected mode. |
| **9 - 16**  | **PB0 - PB7** | **Port B (8-bit)**: Another bidirectional data bus for input/output. Like Port A, it can be configured as input or output in different modes. |
| **17 - 24** | **PC0 - PC7** | **Port C (8-bit)**: This port is also bidirectional and is used for control and input/output purposes. It is more often used for control signals or handshaking between devices. |
| **25**      | **A0**        | **Address Pin 0**: Used to select the control word or data register in the 8255A. It helps address the control register. |
| **26**      | **A1**        | **Address Pin 1**: Used along with A0 to select different control modes or configurations. |
| **27**      | **CS**        | **Chip Select**: This pin is active low. It is used to enable or disable the 8255A chip for read or write operations. When **CS** is low, the device is selected for communication. |
| **28**      | **RD**        | **Read**: This pin is active low. It tells the microprocessor to read data from the 8255A. |
| **29**      | **WR**        | **Write**: This pin is active low. It is used to indicate that the microprocessor will write data to the 8255A. |
| **30**      | **RESET**     | **Reset**: This pin is active low. It resets the 8255A and initializes the ports to their default state (i.e., input mode). |
| **31**      | **INT**       | **Interrupt**: This pin is used to generate an interrupt signal to the microprocessor, indicating that an interrupt condition has occurred. |
| **32**      | **VCC**       | **Power Supply (5V)**: This pin provides the power supply to the 8255A. |
| **33**      | **GND**       | **Ground**: This pin is connected to the ground of the system. |

### **Function of Ports (A, B, C)**

- **Port A (PA0 - PA7)**:  
  A bidirectional 8-bit data port. It can be configured for simple input/output (Mode 0), strobed I/O (Mode 1), or bidirectional data transfer (Mode 2).
  
- **Port B (PB0 - PB7)**:  
  Similar to Port A, this is another 8-bit bidirectional data port. It can be configured as input or output and is often used for interfacing devices like sensors, displays, etc.

- **Port C (PC0 - PC7)**:  
  A versatile port, **Port C** can be used either for control signals or as a simple I/O port. In **Mode 0**, it can be used as input or output; in **Mode 1** and **Mode 2**, it can be used to control handshaking between the microprocessor and peripheral devices.

### **Control and Addressing Pins**

- **A0 and A1**:  
  These are the **address lines** that help select the control register. By combining the values of A0 and A1, the microprocessor can address the **control word** or the **data register** of the 8255A. The **addressing** is as follows:
  - **A1, A0 = 00**: Data register (Port A)
  - **A1, A0 = 01**: Data register (Port B)
  - **A1, A0 = 10**: Data register (Port C)
  - **A1, A0 = 11**: Control register (8255A control word)

- **CS (Chip Select)**:  
  This active-low pin is used to enable the 8255A device for communication. If **CS** is high, the 8255A is **disabled** and cannot perform any read/write operations.

- **RD (Read)** and **WR (Write)**:  
  These active-low pins control **data transfer** between the **microprocessor** and the **8255A**.
  - **RD** is used when the microprocessor wants to **read** data from the 8255A.
  - **WR** is used when the microprocessor wants to **write** data to the 8255A.

- **RESET**:  
  When this pin is activated (low), it resets the 8255A, setting its ports to input mode and initializing the device.

- **INT (Interrupt)**:  
  This pin generates an interrupt signal to the microprocessor when the **8255A** requires attention (e.g., when data is ready to be read). The interrupt is used for synchronization in the system.

### **Power Supply and Ground**

- **VCC**:  
  Provides **5V power** to the **8255A**. This is required for its proper operation.

- **GND**:  
  The **ground** pin, which completes the power circuit.

### **Summary of Pin Functionality**

- **Port A (PA0 - PA7)**: 8-bit I/O (input or output)
- **Port B (PB0 - PB7)**: 8-bit I/O (input or output)
- **Port C (PC0 - PC7)**: 8-bit I/O (input or output, or control/handshaking signals)
- **A0, A1**: Address pins for selecting the control or data register
- **CS**: Chip Select (active low, to select 8255A)
- **RD**: Read control pin (active low)
- **WR**: Write control pin (active low)
- **RESET**: Reset pin (active low, for initialization)
- **INT**: Interrupt pin (active high, to signal the microprocessor)
- **VCC**: Power supply (5V)
- **GND**: Ground pin

This pin configuration allows the **8255A** to interface easily with external peripherals, allowing flexible I/O operations and control through its programmable ports and modes.
