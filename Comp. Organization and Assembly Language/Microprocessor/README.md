> A microprocessor is a small, integrated circuit (IC) that acts as the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer or other digital device. It performs a variety of tasks, including executing instructions, performing calculations, and controlling other components within a system. The microprocessor is the "brain" of the device and is essential for tasks like running programs, managing memory, and coordinating input/output operations.
