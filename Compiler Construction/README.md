# Compiler Construction

> Compiler design refers to the process of creating a compiler, which is a special program used to convert high-level programming code (such as C, Java, or Python) into machine code or intermediate code that a computer can execute. It involves a series of stages that process the source code, analyze it, and generate an output in the form of an executable program.

### **Introduction to Compiler Design**
- **[Compiler Design](https://github.com/aw-junaid/Computer-Science/blob/main/Compiler%20Construction/course/Compiler%20Design.md)**  
  Provides an overview of compiler design, explaining its role in programming, how it translates high-level code to machine code, and its importance.

- **[Architecture](https://github.com/aw-junaid/Computer-Science/blob/main/Compiler%20Construction/course/Architecture.md)**  
  Explains the architecture of a compiler, including the major components like the front end (analysis phase), the back end (synthesis phase), and their interactions.

### **Phases of a Compiler**
- **[Phases of Compiler](https://github.com/aw-junaid/Computer-Science/blob/main/Compiler%20Construction/course/Phases%20of%20Compiler.md)**  
  Details the sequential phases of a compiler, from lexical analysis to code generation and optimization.

### **Lexical Analysis**
- **[Lexical Analysis](https://github.com/aw-junaid/Computer-Science/blob/main/Compiler%20Construction/course/Lexical%20Analysis.md)**  
  Describes the first phase of compilation, where the source code is divided into tokens (basic units of code like keywords and symbols).

- **[Regular Expressions](https://github.com/aw-junaid/Computer-Science/blob/main/Compiler%20Construction/course/Regular%20Expressions.md)**  
  Discusses how regular expressions are used in defining patterns for tokens in the source code.

- **[Finite Automata](https://github.com/aw-junaid/Computer-Science/blob/main/Compiler%20Construction/course/Finite%20Automata.md)**  
  Explains finite automata and their role in implementing lexical analyzers to recognize patterns defined by regular expressions.

### **Syntax Analysis**
- **[Syntax Analysis](https://github.com/aw-junaid/Computer-Science/blob/main/Compiler%20Construction/course/Syntax%20Analysis.md)**  
  Covers the parsing phase of a compiler, where the structure of the source code is analyzed to check its grammatical correctness.

- **[Types of Parsing](https://github.com/aw-junaid/Computer-Science/blob/main/Compiler%20Construction/course/Types%20of%20Parsing.md)**  
  Explains the two primary parsing strategies: top-down parsing and bottom-up parsing.

- **[Top-down Parsers](https://github.com/aw-junaid/Computer-Science/blob/main/Compiler%20Construction/course/Top-Down%20Parser.md)**  
  Focuses on top-down parsing techniques, such as recursive descent parsing, which build parse trees from the top.

- **[Bottom-Up Parser](https://github.com/aw-junaid/Computer-Science/blob/main/Compiler%20Construction/course/Bottom-Up%20Parser.md)**  
  Discusses bottom-up parsing techniques, which start constructing parse trees from the leaves and work upward.

- **[Error Recovery](https://github.com/aw-junaid/Computer-Science/blob/main/Compiler%20Construction/course/Error%20Recovery.md)**  
  Explains how compilers handle syntax and semantic errors during parsing, using various recovery methods like panic-mode and phrase-level recovery.

---

### **Semantic Analysis**
- **[Semantic Analysis](https://github.com/aw-junaid/Computer-Science/blob/main/Compiler%20Construction/course/Semantic%20Analysis.md)**  
  Details the process of verifying the meaning of the source code, checking for type mismatches, and ensuring the program adheres to semantic rules.

---

### **Run-Time and Intermediate Representations**
- **[Run-Time Environment](https://github.com/aw-junaid/Computer-Science/blob/main/Compiler%20Construction/course/Run-Time%20Environment.md)**  
  Discusses how the compiler prepares the program for execution by setting up memory allocation, stack management, and symbol linking.

- **[Symbol Table](https://github.com/aw-junaid/Computer-Science/blob/main/Compiler%20Construction/course/Symbol%20Table.md)**  
  Explains how compilers use symbol tables to store information about identifiers like variables, functions, and their attributes.

- **[Intermediate Code Generation](https://github.com/aw-junaid/Computer-Science/blob/main/Compiler%20Construction/course/Intermediate%20Code%20Generation.md)**  
  Discusses the generation of intermediate code, which serves as an abstraction layer between the source code and machine code.

---

### **Code Generation and Optimization**
- **[Code Generation](https://github.com/aw-junaid/Computer-Science/blob/main/Compiler%20Construction/course/Code%20Generation.md)**  
  Details the final phase of compilation, where optimized machine code is generated from intermediate code.

- **[Code Optimization](https://github.com/aw-junaid/Computer-Science/blob/main/Compiler%20Construction/course/Code%20Optimization.md)**  
  Focuses on techniques to improve the performance and efficiency of the generated code, such as loop unrolling and dead code elimination.
