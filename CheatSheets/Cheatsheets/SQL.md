An extended SQL cheat sheet that covers essential commands, clauses, and concepts used in SQL (Structured Query Language). This cheat sheet provides examples and explanations for each item, making it easier to understand and implement SQL in database management.

---

## **1. Basic SQL Syntax**

### 1.1 SQL Statement Structure

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**Explanation**: This is the basic structure of a SQL query, which retrieves specific columns from a table based on a condition.

---

## **2. Data Retrieval**

### 2.1 SELECT Statement

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;  -- Select all columns
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees;  -- Select specific columns
```

**Explanation**: The `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables.

---

## **3. Filtering Data**

### 3.1 WHERE Clause

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';
```

**Explanation**: The `WHERE` clause filters records based on specified conditions.

### 3.2 Operators

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;  -- Greater than
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'J%';   -- Starts with J
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE hire_date BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2020-12-31';  -- Between two values
```

**Explanation**: Common operators include:
- `=` (equal)
- `!=` or `<>` (not equal)
- `>` (greater than)
- `<` (less than)
- `LIKE` (pattern matching)
- `BETWEEN` (range checking)

---

## **4. Sorting Data**

### 4.1 ORDER BY Clause

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY last_name ASC;  -- Ascending order
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;    -- Descending order
```

**Explanation**: The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the result set based on one or more columns.

---

## **5. Aggregating Data**

### 5.1 Aggregate Functions

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;                 -- Count of rows
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;               -- Average salary
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees;               -- Maximum salary
SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employees;               -- Minimum salary
SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;               -- Total salary
```

**Explanation**: Aggregate functions perform calculations on multiple rows and return a single value.

---

## **6. Grouping Data**

### 6.1 GROUP BY Clause

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department;
```

**Explanation**: The `GROUP BY` clause groups rows sharing a property so that aggregate functions can be applied to each group.

### 6.2 HAVING Clause

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000;
```

**Explanation**: The `HAVING` clause filters groups based on aggregate functions, similar to the `WHERE` clause but applied to groups.

---

## **7. Joining Tables**

### 7.1 INNER JOIN

```sql
SELECT employees.first_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

**Explanation**: The `INNER JOIN` clause returns records that have matching values in both tables.

### 7.2 LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)

```sql
SELECT employees.first_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

**Explanation**: The `LEFT JOIN` returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table; unmatched records will contain NULL.

### 7.3 RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

```sql
SELECT employees.first_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

**Explanation**: The `RIGHT JOIN` returns all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table.

### 7.4 FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)

```sql
SELECT employees.first_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
FULL JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

**Explanation**: The `FULL JOIN` returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table records.

---

## **8. Modifying Data**

### 8.1 INSERT Statement

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, salary) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 60000);
```

**Explanation**: The `INSERT INTO` statement adds new rows to a table.

### 8.2 UPDATE Statement

```sql
UPDATE employees SET salary = 65000 WHERE first_name = 'John' AND last_name = 'Doe';
```

**Explanation**: The `UPDATE` statement modifies existing records in a table based on specified conditions.

### 8.3 DELETE Statement

```sql
DELETE FROM employees WHERE last_name = 'Doe';
```

**Explanation**: The `DELETE` statement removes rows from a table based on specified conditions.

---

## **9. Creating and Modifying Tables**

### 9.1 CREATE TABLE Statement

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    hire_date DATE
);
```

**Explanation**: The `CREATE TABLE` statement defines a new table and its columns.

### 9.2 ALTER TABLE Statement

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN department_id INT;   -- Add a column
ALTER TABLE employees DROP COLUMN department_id;      -- Drop a column
```

**Explanation**: The `ALTER TABLE` statement modifies an existing table structure.

### 9.3 DROP TABLE Statement

```sql
DROP TABLE employees;
```

**Explanation**: The `DROP TABLE` statement deletes a table and all of its data.

---

## **10. Indexes**

### 10.1 Creating an Index

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_lastname ON employees(last_name);
```

**Explanation**: The `CREATE INDEX` statement creates an index on one or more columns to improve query performance.

---

## **11. Constraints**

### 11.1 Adding Constraints

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,        -- Unique constraint
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (salary > 0)  -- Check constraint
);
```

**Explanation**: Constraints enforce rules on data in a table, including primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints.

---

## **12. Transactions**

### 12.1 Transactions

```sql
BEGIN;                       -- Start a transaction
UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.1;  -- Some updates
COMMIT;                     -- Save changes
ROLLBACK;                  -- Revert changes (if needed)
```

**Explanation**: Transactions ensure a sequence of operations are completed successfully. If an error occurs, a `ROLLBACK` can revert the database to its previous state.

---

## **13. Views**

### 13.1 Creating a View

```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_salaries AS
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
```

**Explanation**: A `VIEW` is a virtual table based on the result of a query. It simplifies complex queries and enhances security.

---

## **14. Stored Procedures and Functions**

### 14.1 Creating a Stored Procedure

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE get_employee_count()
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;
END;
```

**Explanation**: Stored procedures encapsulate SQL code for reuse and can take parameters.

### 14.2 Creating a Function

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION get_salary(employee_id INT) RETURNS DECIMAL(10, 2)
BEGIN
    RETURN (SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE id = employee_id);
END;
```

**Explanation**: Functions return a single value and can be used within SQL statements.

---

## **15. Subqueries**

### 15.1 Subquery Example

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees WHERE department_id = (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE name = 'Sales');
```

**Explanation**: A subquery is a query nested inside another query, often used to retrieve values that will be used in the outer query.

---

## **16. Common SQL Functions**

### 16.1 Common Functions

```sql
SELECT UPPER(first_name) FROM employees;     -- Convert to uppercase
SELECT LOWER(last_name) FROM employees;       -- Convert to lowercase
SELECT LENGTH(first_name) FROM employees;     -- Length of string
SELECT NOW();                                  -- Current date and time
```

**Explanation**: SQL provides a variety of built-in functions for string manipulation, date/time handling, and more.
