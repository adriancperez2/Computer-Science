# **Protocol Data Unit (PDU) Cheat Sheet**

## **1. Definition of PDU**
- **Protocol Data Unit (PDU)**: A PDU is a unit of data specified in a protocol of a given layer. It consists of both the header and the payload (data). Each layer of the OSI model has its own type of PDU, which helps in the communication and functioning of network protocols.

## **2. PDUs by OSI Model Layers**

| **Layer**          | **PDU Name**          | **Description**                                               | **Common Protocols**                       |
|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Application Layer   | Message                | Data generated by applications.                                | HTTP, FTP, SMTP                            |
| Presentation Layer  | Message                | Data representation and formatting.                           | SSL/TLS, JPEG, ASCII                       |
| Session Layer       | Message                | Session management data.                                      | RPC, NetBIOS                               |
| Transport Layer     | Segment (TCP) / Datagram (UDP) | Ensures reliable or unreliable delivery of data.             | TCP, UDP                                   |
| Network Layer       | Packet                 | Contains routing information, including source and destination IP addresses. | IP (IPv4, IPv6), ICMP                      |
| Data Link Layer     | Frame                  | Includes physical addressing (MAC addresses) and error detection. | Ethernet, PPP                              |
| Physical Layer      | Bit                    | Raw bits transmitted over a physical medium.                  | RS-232, Ethernet cables                    |

## **3. Characteristics of PDUs**
- **Encapsulation**: PDUs are created as data passes down through the OSI layers. Each layer adds its own header (and sometimes a footer) to the data.
- **De-Encapsulation**: When data reaches the receiving end, each layer removes its respective header/footer as it moves up through the OSI layers.
  
### **Example of Encapsulation**:
- **Application Data** (User data) → **Transport Segment** (adds TCP/UDP header) → **Network Packet** (adds IP header) → **Data Link Frame** (adds MAC address) → **Physical Bits** (converts frames into bits for transmission).

## **4. PDU Examples by Layer**

### **Application Layer**
- **PDU**: Message
- **Usage**: Sending an email via SMTP.
- **Command Example**:
  ```bash
  telnet mail.example.com 25
  ```
  - Opens a connection to an SMTP server to send a message.

### **Transport Layer**
- **PDU**: Segment (TCP) / Datagram (UDP)
- **Usage**: Establishing a TCP connection to a web server.
- **Command Example** (TCP):
  ```bash
  curl -v http://example.com
  ```
  - This command uses HTTP over TCP, encapsulating the data in a segment.

### **Network Layer**
- **PDU**: Packet
- **Usage**: Routing packets across networks.
- **Command Example**:
  ```bash
  traceroute example.com
  ```
  - Displays the path packets take to reach the target, showing IP packet routing.

### **Data Link Layer**
- **PDU**: Frame
- **Usage**: Sending data within a local network.
- **Command Example**:
  ```bash
  arp -a
  ```
  - Shows the MAC addresses of devices in the local network, indicating frame addressing.

### **Physical Layer**
- **PDU**: Bit
- **Usage**: Sending raw data over a physical medium.
- **Command Example**:
  ```bash
  ifconfig
  ```
  - Displays the configuration of network interfaces, representing physical connection states.

## **5. Summary of PDU by Layer**

- **Application**: **Message** - Represents the data users work with (HTTP, SMTP).
- **Transport**: **Segment** (TCP) / **Datagram** (UDP) - Manages delivery and error correction.
- **Network**: **Packet** - Contains routing information for delivery across networks.
- **Data Link**: **Frame** - Physical addressing for local networks.
- **Physical**: **Bit** - Actual binary transmission over cables or wireless.

## **6. Conclusion**

Understanding Protocol Data Units (PDUs) is essential for grasping how data is transmitted across networks in various formats. Each layer of the OSI model uses its specific PDU to facilitate communication, and knowing these allows for better network design, troubleshooting, and protocol implementation.
