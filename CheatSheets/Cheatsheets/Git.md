## **Git Configuration Commands**

### 1. **Setting Up Git**

```bash
# Set your username
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# Set your email address
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"

# Check the configuration settings
git config --list
```

**Explanation**: These commands configure your identity in Git. The `--global` flag applies these settings to all repositories on your machine.

### 2. **Customizing Git**

```bash
# Set your default editor for Git
git config --global core.editor "vim"

# Enable colored output for Git commands
git config --global color.ui auto
```

**Explanation**: Set preferences for the text editor Git will use for commands like `commit` and for enabling color in Git output.

## **Basic Git Commands**

### 3. **Creating a New Repository**

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init
```

**Explanation**: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory, creating a `.git` folder to track changes.

### 4. **Cloning a Repository**

```bash
# Clone a repository
git clone <repository-url>
```

**Explanation**: Downloads a repository and its history to your local machine. This is commonly used to get a copy of a remote repository.

### 5. **Checking Status**

```bash
# Check the status of the working directory
git status
```

**Explanation**: Shows the state of the working directory, including tracked and untracked files, staged changes, and commits that need pushing or pulling.

---

## **Working with Files**

### 6. **Adding Files to Staging Area**

```bash
# Stage a specific file
git add <file-name>

# Stage all changes in the current directory
git add .
```

**Explanation**: Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area, preparing them for the next commit. 

### 7. **Removing Files**

```bash
# Remove a file from the repository and the working directory
git rm <file-name>

# Remove a file from staging but keep it in the working directory
git rm --cached <file-name>
```

**Explanation**: `git rm` deletes a file from the working directory and staging area, while `--cached` only unstages the file.

### 8. **Moving/Renaming Files**

```bash
# Move or rename a file
git mv <old-name> <new-name>
```

**Explanation**: Renames or moves a file in the repository, staging the change automatically for the next commit.

---

## **Committing Changes**

### 9. **Creating a Commit**

```bash
# Commit changes with a message
git commit -m "commit message"

# Commit all tracked changes directly
git commit -a -m "commit message"
```

**Explanation**: Commits add changes from the staging area to the repository. `-a` stages and commits tracked files in one step.

### 10. **Amending Commits**

```bash
# Modify the last commit
git commit --amend -m "updated commit message"
```

**Explanation**: `--amend` lets you modify the last commit message or add changes without creating a new commit.

---

## **Branching & Merging**

### 11. **Creating a Branch**

```bash
# Create a new branch
git branch <branch-name>

# Switch to a new branch
git checkout <branch-name>

# Create and switch to a branch in one step
git switch -c <branch-name>
```

**Explanation**: Branches allow you to work on features independently. Use `git branch` to create and `git checkout` or `git switch` to switch to branches.

### 12. **Viewing Branches**

```bash
# List all branches
git branch

# List remote branches
git branch -r
```

**Explanation**: Shows local or remote branches in your repository.

### 13. **Merging Branches**

```bash
# Merge a branch into the current branch
git merge <branch-name>
```

**Explanation**: Incorporates changes from one branch into another. You may need to resolve conflicts if both branches modified the same lines.

### 14. **Deleting a Branch**

```bash
# Delete a local branch
git branch -d <branch-name>

# Force delete a branch (if it has unmerged changes)
git branch -D <branch-name>
```

**Explanation**: Deletes a branch locally. Use `-D` to force delete if there are unmerged changes.

---

## **Working with Remotes**

### 15. **Adding a Remote Repository**

```bash
# Add a remote repository
git remote add origin <repository-url>
```

**Explanation**: Connects your local repository to a remote, enabling you to push and pull changes.

### 16. **Pushing Changes**

```bash
# Push local changes to the remote repository
git push origin <branch-name>
```

**Explanation**: Uploads your local commits to the corresponding branch on the remote repository.

### 17. **Fetching and Pulling Changes**

```bash
# Fetch updates from the remote repository
git fetch origin

# Fetch and merge changes into the current branch
git pull origin <branch-name>
```

**Explanation**: `git fetch` retrieves changes from a remote but doesn’t merge them, while `git pull` fetches and merges updates directly.

### 18. **Removing a Remote**

```bash
# Remove a remote
git remote remove origin
```

**Explanation**: Deletes a reference to a remote repository, effectively disconnecting it.

---

## **Rebasing and Cherry-Picking**

### 19. **Rebasing a Branch**

```bash
# Rebase the current branch onto another branch
git rebase <branch-name>
```

**Explanation**: Rebasing applies changes from one branch onto another, creating a linear history. This can simplify the commit log.

### 20. **Cherry-Picking Commits**

```bash
# Apply a specific commit from another branch
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

**Explanation**: Copies a specific commit from one branch to another. Useful for bringing over isolated changes without merging.

---

## **Viewing and Resetting History**

### 21. **Viewing Commit History**

```bash
# View commit history
git log

# View a summarized commit history
git log --oneline
```

**Explanation**: Displays the commit history, helping you trace back changes and their authors.

### 22. **Viewing Differences**

```bash
# View differences in modified files
git diff

# View staged differences
git diff --staged
```

**Explanation**: Shows changes between files in the working directory and staged area, useful for reviewing uncommitted changes.

### 23. **Resetting Commits**

```bash
# Reset to a specific commit, discarding later commits
git reset --hard <commit-hash>

# Move to a commit, keeping changes in the working directory
git reset --soft <commit-hash>
```

**Explanation**: `git reset` moves the current branch to a different commit. `--hard` discards all changes, while `--soft` preserves them.

---

## **Stashing and Cleaning**

### 24. **Stashing Changes**

```bash
# Stash current changes
git stash

# Apply the latest stash
git stash apply

# List all stashes
git stash list
```

**Explanation**: Temporarily saves uncommitted changes, allowing you to switch branches or make other changes without committing.

### 25. **Cleaning Untracked Files**

```bash
# Remove untracked files from the working directory
git clean -f

# Dry-run (preview) of clean
git clean -n
```

**Explanation**: Deletes untracked files from the working directory. Use `-n` to preview changes before applying.

---

## **Advanced Git Commands**

### 26. **Interactive Rebase**

```bash
# Start an interactive rebase for the last n commits
git rebase -i HEAD~n
```

**Explanation**: `git rebase -i` lets you modify commit history by editing, reordering, or squashing commits into one.

### 27. **Reflog (Recovering Lost Commits)**

```bash
# Show the reflog
git reflog
```

**Explanation**: `git reflog` records all changes made to the repository, including those not visible in the log, which can help you recover lost commits.

### 28. **Bisect (Finding Bugs)**

```bash
# Start a bisect session
git bisect start

# Mark the current commit as bad
git bisect bad

# Mark a known good commit
git bisect good <commit-hash>
```

**Explanation**: `git bisect` helps identify which commit introduced a bug by using a binary search.

---

## **Tagging**

### 29. **Tagging Commits**

```bash
# Create an annotated tag
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1.0 release"

# Push tags to remote
git push origin --tags
```

**Explanation**: Tags mark specific commits, typically for releases. Annotated tags include descriptions and are ideal for labeling important points.

### 30. **Viewing and Deleting Tags**

```bash
# List all tags
git tag

# Delete a tag
git tag -d <tag-name>
```

**Explanation**: Shows or removes

 tags. This is useful for managing versions or releases in your project.
