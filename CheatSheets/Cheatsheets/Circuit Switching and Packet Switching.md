|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**           | Establishes a dedicated path between sender and receiver before data transfer. | Divides data into packets that are sent independently across the network. |
| **Connection Type**      | Connection-oriented                                                   | Connectionless (though connection-oriented protocols exist, e.g., TCP) |
| **Dedicated Path**       | Yes, fixed path for each session                                      | No, packets may take different paths to reach the destination          |
| **Bandwidth Utilization**| Fixed, reserved for duration of session                               | Dynamic, more efficient utilization based on demand                    |
| **Latency**              | Low once connection is established                                    | Variable, depending on network congestion and path chosen              |
| **Use Case Examples**    | Traditional telephony, older voice networks                           | Internet, email, streaming, file transfer                              |

| **Session Maintenance**  | End-to-end connection maintained throughout session  | No end-to-end session; each packet is independent  |
| **Data Integrity**       | High, as data is continuously sent through the same path | May vary; packets can arrive out of order          |
| **Circuit Teardown**     | Required after data transfer completion              | Not required; packets self-terminate upon arrival  |
